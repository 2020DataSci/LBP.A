The data listed under the folder 'bad data' was collected using an ammended method which sometimes generated faulty
datapoints. Some of those datapoints pulled obscure versions of the song from Spotify, and thus have lower number
of listens than they should. The mistake was infrequent, but affects the integrity of the data. We plan to recollect
the faulty data if time permits.
