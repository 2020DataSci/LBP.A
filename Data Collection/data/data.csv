Summers Over Interlude,Drake,"

[Intro: Majid Al Maskati]
Ooh, baby, yeah

[Verse: Majid Al Maskati]
Days in the sun
And nights in the rain
Summer is over, simple and plain
Found me some fun that's good for the pain
Already told you, I don't feel the same
I don't feel the same

[Outro: Majid Al Maskati]
Anywhere I go
I can't help but show
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know

Hard to Say I'm Sorry - 2009 Remaster,Chicago,"

[Verse 1]
Everybody needs a little time away
I heard her say, from each other
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away, from each other

[Chorus]
Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to stay

[Post-Chorus]
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me, I can't let go

[Verse 2]
Couldn't stand to be kept away
Just for the day, from your body
Wouldn't wanna be swept away
Far away, from the one that I love

[Chorus]
Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know
Hold me now
I really wanna tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go

[Post-Chorus]
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me, I can't let go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to

[Refrain]
You're gonna be the lucky one

[Outro]

No one'll see us cause there's nobody there
After all, you know we really don't care
Hold on, I'm gonna take you there

Yokluğuma Alışma,No. 1,"

[Verse 1: No. 1]
Kafası bozuk saçmalıyor
Yine saçmalamak için para arıyo'
Tebessüm ediyorum endişeler
Beynimin içinde öksürüyor
Halim iyi kötü çirkin
Aksar kalpteki ritim
Geri döndüm nerelere gitmiştim
Beni böldün hiç bi' boka benzemedim
Bataklığın içindeki yatağa uzan
Bakıp uzaklara dalma yanına pusar
Tabağa sıçanlar seni de bozar
Beni bozamadı neyse yine laf uzar
Uzandım usulca sigarama
Bu yavan ömrüme katık
Ben o gün öldüm gülüm
Hey bir daha ölmem artık

Yollar
Bazen bizi zorlar
Sen nolur unutma
Yokluğuma alışma

Kafama takılıp düşer beden
Yorgunum ama yazıyorum üşenmeden yine
Dumana boğulan düşünceler bile
Amaçsız bi savaş içindeler niye
Kapatamıyorum gökyüzünü
Bırak yalanı gururu dök yüzünü
Her şeyi götür ama kalsın sadece
Sigaram küllüğüm ve öksürüğüm
Ciğerim kötü halen iyiyim
Maskeli bu oyun ve de galibiyim
Tebessüm ediyosan endişe yok boşver
Kafanda kuruntu daha ne diyim
Lanet ışığı kapat bitsin ömrüm
Zamana bıraktım ilke döndüm
Gözümü açamadım bir bez örtü
Bir daha ölmem ben bir kez öldüm

Two A.M. Lovesick,Blue October,"

I walk like a burned out porn star
With aching feet for a car
My buddy had a baby with a girl named Star
Makes me appreciate how the little things are

But crossing a road isn't easily told
To a young, has-been centerfold
Labeled a winner's episode

Yeah, I'm really clean if you know what I mean
Except for this reoccurring dream
Of losing total feeling
While the windmill's squealing
The windmill's squealing

I paint to kill the dead saints
I paint to make it clear
My colors run in blue and gray
But they give hope to someone dear

Yeah, yeah, yeah, 2 AM lovesick
With a walking pneumonia drum-kick
And this candle doesn't have a wick
But I'm really not that scared
No, I'm not that scared

I walk like a burned out porn star
With aching feet for a car
My buddy had a baby with a girl named Star
Makes me appreciate how the little things are

Encounter,Single Wound,"

I’ve spent my days here away from everyone
Encountering everything I’ve ever done 

My own hands around my neck dragging me back to where I was
If you only knew how much I gave a fuck 

(It’s not enough) It never is
Desperately reaching for a moment of bliss
But I guess I’m just an anxious piece of shit

My mind is blinded by my past and it won’t die if I keep looking back

I need to know if I’m alone or not

Do you hate yourself the way that I hate the world ?

We can get through this encounter

I don't wanna go home!
Don't bring the lights up, don't ring the bell
Once the whistle has blown;
God only knows when we'll meet here again!

Tell the band not to stop
Tell the curtain, don't drop
Keep the barstool King
High on his throne!
I don't wanna go Home!

Don't wanna leave till it's all said and done
Guess I should have known:
I'd want to stay until we'd seen the sun

It's just the moment to make:
This perfect mistake
Until we spend hours alone
I don't want to go home

You can never look back
It's a lesson that some never learn
But I won't forget it
I won't be caught treading

All the punches I've thrown
And all the wounded who fueled my escape

Tell the curtain, don't drop
Keep the barstool King
High on his throne!

There's a well-broken heart
Who's willing to cast the first stone

No I don't want to go home

Hold a shell, a stick or play
Overheard a lark today, losing when my mind's astray
Don't you want to know with your pretty hair?
Stretch out your hand
Glad feel in an echo for your way

It's an idea someday
In my tears, my dreams
Don't you want to see her proof?
Life that comes of no harm
You and I and dominoes
The day goes by

Didn't anyone ever tell you
Didn't anyone ever say
Did you capture a vision of glory
As she held out her hand today
It's reaching to the broken heart
Right down to where you stand

Didn't anyone ever tell you
This is your land
Didn't anyone ever tell you
It doesn't matter the last will be first
For the sad and the meek and the righteous
And all those who will hunger and thirst
So let the poor in spirit know
These dreams are not of sand
Didn't anyone ever tell you
This is your land

You'll be given the robes of princes
You'll be flying on golden wings
You will live in pavilions of splendor
Be surrounded by beautiful things
So hold on to these promises
And keep them in your hand

Didn't anyone ever tell you
This is your land

I stole the outside
Running into the sun
I'm alive
I'm loud, as a golden gun
I killed my pride
So once again I'd see

Live and learn
You've fallen, one thousand times
I feel the burn
There's fire from a crazy sky
I sealed concern
So once again I'd be

And it lifts you up
Then it puts you down
And it feeds you life
Then it lets you drown
While it holds your heart
Then it slowly tears you apart
And you know, that life is what I mean

If I could (and if I could)
You know, I'd stand on the rock
Where Jesus stood (where Jesus stood)
Innocence, and evil bad
And good (good, and good)
Walking side by side

[Chorus]
And it lifts you up
Then it puts you down
Then it feeds you life
Then it lets you drown
While it holds your heart
And it slowly tears you apart
And you know, you know, you know, life is what I mean

We got a way, of making up our minds (you know we have our minds)
How could I run, just leave it all behind?
When it breaks me up inside
Still I refuse to hide
And it is, just what it is
And that's all right

And it lifts you up
Then it puts you down
And it feeds you life
Then it lets you drown

Ring-a-ling, hear them sing

Yes, I remember
The silver bells of my youth
From the streets of Brooklyn
They rang up through my window
And made me smile

Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the mallers rush home
With their treasures

Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle

Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love

Don't you think it's rather funny
I should be in this position?
I'm the one who's always been
So calm so cool no lovers fool

You're a hundred worlds away now
I'm sure its for the best
You're practically a stranger now
But you stand out from the rest
Cause I remember you
I remember you

I remember you
You told the stories of your scars
We kept each others secrets
And slept in empty cars

I remember you
I showed you how to kiss
I let you shoot my hats off
Cause I knew you wouldn't miss
And I remember you
I remember you

I remember you
We would've died intertwined
We talked in tongues of a kinship
We could only deny
Now you think you're anonymous
A masked face without a name
But I know you're one of us
Underneath you're still the same
And I remember you
I remember you

The Zodiac,Kamelot,"

She was so kind to me
She sang her little shadow song
And I could not resist it
Bitter blood, come sing along

With your hand upon the bible
Would you swear that is the truth?
(The whole truth and the truth alone)

If she had only shut her mouth

Shattered memories
Of quiet cold rejection
A careful devil's irony
In pure perfection
In pure deceit

You ask me
Was it all I had to tell?
Was it all I could recall?
No.. then I broke her neck
A twisted china white facade
I may seem unaffected
But don’t we all want to be God?

Is it all you can remember?
Would you swear it on your life?

You will never really know my name
Without reflection
A careful devil's irony
In pure perfection
In pure deceit

But in the moment it’s so beautiful
Flow along with the hunger
With the nature of the beast

These are shattered memories
Of quiet cold rejection
A careful devil's irony
In pure perfection
You will never really know my name
Without reflection
A careful devil's irony
In pure perfection
In pure deceit

The Return of the Sorcerer,Orne,"

Thinking back my rotten life
Sacrifices and nameless crimes
All those things have lost their shine
Everything is pale in my eyes
Generations of learning the art
Of perfect focus, ignoring their cries
Never caring, always closing my heart
I turn away, repeating my signs
Five, five, five, five, five; Asmodeus destroy him
Nine, nine, nine, nine, nine; Bael protect me
Out from the darkness I hear voices
Must be my brother breaking free
And every night I wake up wondering:
Did I destroy the final key?
In the moment of dimming light
I am dressed in ceremonial ways
The Gate is opened, revealed and tried
I surrender at the end of my days

Sorry, don't got no chill

Poppin' the pharmaceuticals mama left in the cabinet
Gang, gang, it's a knife, I'm stabbin' it

Thank you for drippin' on me like a windshield

Leave her body here, we're makin' a big film

Stay out of the shadows
You just might find this world has a cold dark touch

I watch you fade away to a place where lives are lost
Season after season this mask regenerates
To cover the abrasions that your body has sustained

We carried you for too long
Now this back is about to break
I wish these arms were stronger
Cause I can't bare the weight

Seven years and counting
We lived this masquerade
But now the party is over
They are all out of your champagne

These silhouettes are moving in and out
Like headhunters, you dug yourself a grave
It's just too hard to watch you fall apart
I used to think this could all work out

Give me faith
Show me some kind of sign
So I know you're still alive
Give me faith
Show me some kind of sign
So I know that you can hear me behind those diamond eyes!

Our whole universe was in a hot dense state
Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait...
The Earth began to cool
The autotrophs began to drool
Neanderthals developed tools
We built a wall (we built the pyramids)
Math, science, history, unraveling the mystery
That all started with the big bang!

Since the dawn of man is really not that long
As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song
A fraction of a second and the elements were made
The bipeds stood up straight
The dinosaurs all met their fate
They tried to leap but they were late
And they all died (they froze their asses off)
The oceans and pangea
See ya wouldn't wanna be ya
Set in motion by the same big bang!

It will pause and start to go the other way

Choose What You Love Most (Let It Kill You),Lara Fabian,"

[Verse 1]
Was in a place where I wished for the love of my life
I've suffered more in these arms and I thought I would die
And now I tremble on the brink like a shivering child
Praying not to fall, if it hurts it will be worth a flight

[Pre-Chorus]
If I blow it, I'll know it
I'll face it with my open broken heart and my wiser eyes
If I blow it so goes in
I won't regret a thing I did, just the things I didn't try

[Chorus]
Choose what you love most, and let it kill you
If you have to
Choose what you love most, and let it kill you
And let it kill you

[Verse 2]
My freedom wasted to surrender and give you my life
I feel that I'm over my head but I'm taking the dive
I'll take a breath with your kiss of death, if I survive
I knew with the next breath I'm immortalized

[Pre-Chorus]
If I blow it, I'll know it
I'll face it with my open broken heart and my wiser eyes
If I blow it so goes in
I won't regret a thing I did, just the things I didn't try

[Chorus]
Choose what you love most, and let it kill you
If you have to
Choose what you love most, and let it kill you
Let it kill you

[Outro]
And let it kill you
Let it kill you
Choose what you love most, and let it kill you
Let it kill you
Let it kill you
Let it kill you

J'suis pas comme eux, crois moi j'suis hors norme
HuuH, HuuH, HuuH
L'orage dans mon univers, s'avance
J'veux pas vendre mon âme pour un nom

[Couplet 1]
J'fais les choses, elle baraude la night, ma Terre, une fois de plus j'suis pas là
J'prepare un carnage, mais pour l'instant je suis posté en bas
Pour notre honneur, j'irai jusque là bas, si j'en suis là c'est pas un hasard
J'fais les choses mais j'suis pas très bavard, j'fais parti de cette espèce à part
J'ai appuyé sur la gâchette et les balles fusent dans ma tête
J'vois bien que je vais les [?], sachez qu'ici, bah tout s’achète
Jeune négro depuis le berceau, par la guitare du daron bercé
Imaginais déjà Bercy, quelle est l'autre vision du mot percer

[Refrain]
J'suis pas comme eux, crois moi j'suis hors norme
Incompris parce que j'suis hors norme
J'suis dans la cabine pendant qu'ils s'endorment
J'rigole quand on me demande ""c'est comment ?""

Fuck toutes ces bitches, ce ne sont que des futilités
Éduqué par mon silence, je fais dans la furtivité
J'rentre pas dans leurs jeux de vos sors téléguidées
Faut dire des ""nique ta mère"" pour faire mouiller les petites
L'ami je viens de l'Essonne, je viens braquer l'hexagone
De gré ou de force je pourrais trouver le sommeil
La soif de réussite me dévore, faut qu'à l'avant je m'accroche
Comme la feuille dès l'automne, qui ne veut pas que le vent l'emporte
L'espoir me résonne, j'les laisse croire que je dors
Chaque mot vaut de l'or, c'est pour cela que j'suis hors norme
J'suis toujours le gars de dehors, qui fuck les cops
Pas de limites, pas de menottes, perdre n'est pas de mon ressort

Tampoco sé lo que esperas de mí

Agáchate, cuida que esta pena
No te dure demasiado
Sorprendente, y aprende a volar
Intenta volar en los espacios cerraos
Recuérdate que lo que sube
Rápido cae en picao

Que me duele verte así
Y no se ya como ayudarte
Que quiero lo mejor pa' ti
Y quisiera poder abrazarte

Que me duele verte así
Ya no se ni como ayudarte

Si, si la cabeza no para de girar
Si sientes que la fuerza se te va
Y siempre tiene gana de escapar, de escapar
Anímate, a crecer en la vida
En esta vida que te ha toca'o
Reinvetate y siente la alegría
De los que están a tu lado
Levántate sin echar cuenta
De las veces que has tropezao

Niin paljo mentävä ja tehtävä on
Ja ne sanoo vaan et elämä on, elämä on
Ja mä tiedän et niin paljon enemmän on
Mut ne sanoo vaan et elämä on, elämä on
Niin paljon mentävä ja tehtävä on
Ja ne sanoo vaan et elämä on, elämä on
Ja mä tiedän et niin paljon enemmän on
Mut ne sanoo vaan et elämä on, elämä on

Jatkuvaa päätä seinään hakkaamista, kaukana onnellisuudest
Todellistuudessa se on jatkuvaa onnen jahtaamista
Ja jaksamista vastoinkäymisest toiseen
Oon kantanu taakkaa hartioil, jos joku ottais pois sen
En olis vieläkään onnellinen, mut vähän lähempänä
Ja kun sä kuulet tämän, ymmärrät et lähen tänään
Mun on vaan lähdettävä, pienet piirit ahdistaa
Aina sama laulu, mä en vaan voi tanssii sen tahdissa
Mut jos sä pystyt niin tanssi vaan, tanssi vaan
Mä tarviin vaan ilmaa, nähtävänä maailma
En jämähtämään valmiina, mun on vaan mentävä tänään
Kun samat vanhat maisemat on masentava nähä
Vähän parempana tänään, ei se niin pahalt tunnu
Silti matkaa siihen, et voin sanoo, et oon parantunu
Sen ajatuksen voimalla jalat maasta, pois alta
Elämä on toisaalla, nähään siellä

Jossain tuolla silmän kantamattomissa
Horisontissa, meillä kaikil on paikkamme
Niin pitkälle kun pääsee tahdonvoimalla
Se on jossain tuolla, elämä on toisaalla

Elämä heittelee hullun lailla ja mä lentelen kuin leppäkeihäs
Saamatta otetta yhtään mistään
Perheenjäsenist ja ystävistä
Ja ne sanoo, et sä tykkäät joko äideistä tai tyttäristä
Ei molemmista, mä tarviin vielä harkinta-aikaa
Ennen kun jään, ennen niihin kenkiin hyppäämistä
Ei vielä, se päivä ei oo tänään
Mä annan sen odottaa jossain tuolla, siellä nähään
Lupasin ittelleni itekseni etten eksy enää
Kun kaikkea pidin itsestäänselvyytenä
Vasta sun jälkeen ymmärsin kuin tärkeet
On et joku, jolle purkaa murheet ja huolet
On ne jotka välitää on tapetilla
Siksi toisen kyyneleet maistuu omia makeemmilta
Ja mä humalluin niistä niin
Etten pitäny niistä kii, nii ei käy enää

Jossain tuolla silmän kantamattomissa
Horisontissa, meillä kaikil on paikkamme
Niin pitkälle kun pääsee tahdonvoimalla
Se on jossain tuolla, elämä on toisaalla

Ne haluu elää nopeemmin ja kuolla hitaammin
Tajuamatta, että ne kulkee käsi kädessä
Mä pyrin tasapainoon, enkä pääse siihen
Ehkä tänään, tai huomenna, mut se on lähellä
Elämä vilisee niin älyttömän nopeesti
Ennen ku nää lapset ees konttaa, ne osaa kävellä
Mul on määränpää jossain tuolla
Mä en oo siellä, mut oon lähellä, lähempän

Jossain tuolla silmän kantamattomissa
Horisontissa, meillä kaikil on paikkamme
Niin pitkälle kun pääsee tahdonvoimalla
Se on jossain tuolla, elämä on toisaalla

Dreamland,Arwen,"

I had a vision in my mind
Where it was a different world
There people lived other life
In a time out of our control

I've seen moonlight and sun shine
More where sky is pure and clean
I've felt whisperings in the air
And breezes of (other) seas

Will new winds of change come
That they'll bring illusion?
Will lost hope return dreamland?
Where do your tears fall?
Dreamland

Where children's innocence expand
Where there is an only war
Is the one of peace and love
Because laughters invade their hearts

I've seen moonlight...

Will new winds...

Onward for the prophecy to come true
Soaring above the trees
Swift as an arrow speeds
She hears the pounding of the drums
They call her for the battle to be won
She must arrive by dawn
For her to lead them on
Black raven queen of night
She brings her strength and might
For victory
Long ago in her ancient crystal cave
She learned of the warriors she would save
Her quest and destiny
To set her people free
Black raven queen of night
She brings her strength and might
For victory

She brings her strength and might
For victory
Black raven of the night
The hour has arrived

Go bash in a fuckboy's skull, wearin' no mask, toe tag

Fuck all this nice shit, I meddle in murderous temptation

Fuck a bitch, then dip

Louis has lost his brass
Poor old Nat King Cole
Has lost his backstage pass

Just to play for you again

Jimi baby going crazy
While Elvis is getting fat
Freddie's nails are cracking snails
Peter's make-up is running
Through the gallery, the history
Our music hall of fame, again

And we're drowning in a river of past reflection
Caught in the rapids, getting trapped between the rocks
H2O - as clear as daylight
Memories - as clear as daylight
They come flooding back
Flooding back to me, for free!

There's little John with the squeaky voice
Is he coming out to play?
Oh! And there's thoughtful Roger
You know, I never understood a word he had to say
But the band stand waiting for the cue
Just to play for you again, and again

Where are the heroes for today?

This gift can't be a curse
It's time, now rise, rebel
I've heard the heavens and the earth
I've heard many things in hell
I know it's me he haunts
Did I choose this out of greed?
This is no longer a want
This has become a need

How could I sleep at night with so much blood on my hands?
It's only cause I've known this was always my plan

I've held my tongue now, and I've held it well
But there's a secret that I just can't keep
These walls hold a story that I dare not tell
Skeletons not meant for closets lay buried beneath my feet

This can't be right it's all in my head
I swear to God it's still beating
It is the beating of his hideous heart
I always knew that it would come to this
All I've done here is created art
He'll never know his ignorance was my bliss

I hear it beating
I hear it beating
I hear it beating
It is the beating of his hideous heart

Harbor your thoughts please, and halt your lungs
For they can't ever know
They must never know what we have done

I've held my tongue now, and I've held it well
But there's a secret that I just can't keep
These walls hold a story that I dare not tell
Skeletons not meant for closets lay buried beneath my feet

Stay hidden from your conscience
I dare not speak a word
I hold my thoughts to myself, lest my desires be heard
But I've delved way too far into my own mind
And I no longer fear what I know I'll find

I've held my tongue now, and I've held it well
But there's a secret that I just can't keep
These walls hold a story that I dare not tell
Skeletons not meant for closets lay buried beneath my feet

Don't Feed The Heathens,Knights Of The Abyss,"

To the third circle of the underworld where the rains still fall
Diseased and carrying filth a stench fills the air as vile
As the sins that crawl within this evil realm's walls
Excrement falls to fuel the mud filled land in this level of hell

Careful for this realm holds deplorable beings for which you do not wish to be stuck
Cerberus lurks his head holding count of his home
The heads of this beast leave trespassers frozen in stone

Past this mythical canine the bridge to the circle of gluttons is here
The shadowy figure lie on the ground with similar sinners held near

The rains do pound on their heads as the mud begins to rise
In still motion covered in filth for eternity they must lie
Gluttony overcomes them and for their sins they will pay
Until final judgements from the heavenly gates they will stay

Past this mythical canine the bridge to the circle of gluttons is here
The shadowy figure lie on the ground with similar sinners held near

Only concerned with pleasure their earthly existence a waste
Their portly bodies guiding their hunger with haste
Priorities left undone for their lack of ambition we hate
Their indolent ways and deplorable acts unknowingly sealing their fate

Guarded at it's gates the third level is uninhabitable
Putrid and foul the lives of it's sinners berated with rain and hail

[Verse 1]
Standing on the corner just ringing a bell
Searching for heaven and looking like hell
Wondering how I wound up south of that Georgia line
I've been chasing my tail, scratching my feet
Trying to get the rabbit out the l-o-g
But this old dog, he done dug
A little too deep this time, baby

Seeking my inspiration with my nose
These [offline?] situations led to some minor complications

There're some hot-mess honeys dancing on the bar top
Spray-tanned doorman selling me Pop Rocks
""If you're good to drive, boy, I got your bill""
Yeah but you know it's hard to tell where you're going
When it's 85 and snowing
You've powdered your face 'til you can't feel
Lordy Jesus won't you take the wheel

I lost my mind out on the highway
Seeking my inspiration with my nose
These [offline?] situations led to some minor complications
Now I'm sweatin' 'em out in this motel room alone

It's reds and blues; uppers, downers
Left-ers, right-ers; I don't know who's right
But I'm trying to hold on to what little bit of soul I've got
Them expired credit cards and rolled-up singles
Backwater bad deals and men's room mingles
Put rocks to my head, rocks in my shoes
Got me singing them Florida blues

Kings & Queens '18,IsaiahThe3rd,"

Treasures all around and I’m a thief
Only want a woman that’s a queen
Keep her to myself if she a freak
Keep her to myself if she for me

As a boy I wanted to be king
As a boy I wanted to be seen
Every war started over green
Every war started for the queens

All we know is money conversations
All we know is different women naked
Once forgotten I just call em baby
Leather on me softer than Lil Weezy’s

Isaiah got many different meanings
Saving people’s only for the dreamers
Dirty money? Take that to the cleaners
Every child of god ain’t Jesus

I just want her only for her features
I just want her dancing on my penis
In the pink, moving like a fetus
In the pink, avoiding tweets from Peta

When she bite her lips, I’m as good as stiff
If she do it right I might burn a bridge
If she got a friend add em to the list
Swimming in money, Scrooge or Richie Rich

Crowned king since Magikarp
Red jacket since a Gyarados
Whipping water like the Avatar
Tryna find me, I’m in caviar
Won't be caught in no Brenda Strong
Black and mild like he Shannon Sharpe
Rebuilt by Tony Stark
Fooling tourists like matadors

Everyone dies after drinks
Everyone wars over pink
Everyone wanna be Kings
Everyone should see a shrink

When it comes to bling give that to the queens
Handed out some rings made them bend the knee
Make them come to me
Teach em bout the greed

All devices on timeout
Black boxes for the phones now
NSA in everything
Big timers need the big house
Everybody got the red dot
Who ain’t quick to send headshots?
Every meeting at the chess spot
Nature boy with the leg lock
I got the flair
Check out the hair
Look at the gear
Can’t sit with my peers
They at the club, I’m investing in shares
Talking that all or nothing
Talking that Warren Buffet
Khaled I’m up to something

As a boy I wanted to be king
As a boy I wanted to be seen
Every war started over green
Every war started for the queens

I am not such a clever one about the latest fads
I admit I was never one adored by local lads
Not that I ever tried to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint

I'm old fashioned, I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This years fancies are passing fancies
But sighing sighs, holding hands
These my heart understands

I'm old fashioned but I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

Left the TV on, the government is shutting down
My day's wide open
I woke up on the ground, and you were in a cardigan sweater with your horn rimmed glasses on
Can't see the world without them

Living in the pages of a book she read
I sewed a farewell letter with a needle and thread
And called in sick for good
Sitting on an island with the girl I need
I made a fat withdrawal from a cash machine
And I found a place to start again
With my art school girlfriend
Art school girlfriend

""I don't know where it is""
So I climb into bed awake
You got your camera out to take pictures of the mess we made
To save for later
I'm happy wasting away, it's cool
You're in a portable dark room and I'm dreaming of the swimming pool
While I read your latest papers

Mi sto lavando il viso guardando te
Chissà che sognerai
Quante mattine ti ho vista accanto a me
Con gli occhi tuoi nei miei
Conosco come sei, conosco cosa vuoi
Sei come me

La vita ci ha insegnato a vivere
A vivere con noi
E ci ha costretti a crescere
Ma invecchia solo lei
Lei non ci frega più
Lei non ci butta giù
Noi siamo noi

Angeli, a volte diavoli
In questo mondo che non si fa scrupoli
Liberi, ma con dei limiti
Sacrificando i sogni alle abitudini

Tu sei l'unica, forse l'ultima
Fammi volare via, brillami di allegria
Ora svegliati, voglio dirtelo
Anche se già lo sai quello che ti dirò

Chaque fois que tu te reveille

Yes, yes, I love you

Weil nur du mich zum lachen bringst

In questo mondo di sbagli che giusta sei
Sei l'unica lo sai
Ti amo e non riesco a smettere di ridere con te
Bellissima non sei, tranquilla quasi mai
Ma come sei?

Nessuno mai potrà manomettere
L'idea che ho di te
Amarsi è non riflettere, il cuore va da sé
Seguirti nel metrò, sognarti nel paltò
Dentro di me

In questo mondo che non si fa scrupoli
Liberi, ma con dei limiti
Sacrificando i sogni alle abitudini

Siamo complici dentro l'anima

If God don't make mistakes
Pulling the weeds from the ground
As they're growing up
And over the streets of the city

And I can't play it straight
Cause I don't know if it matters
You try to stay calm
As they break your head all is silent

Little iron will
Pushing against the world
What you hope to gain
Is the same as what you're losing

Like a parasite
Living off somebody's life

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
My young niggas tote extentions, still need they mama permission
Bad as hell, on suspension, but thuggin' in the trenches
They hoppin' in my clicque, inheritin' my beef
Heard about when I was thuggin', Maxo see inside the streets
Lil nigga 13, got the older niggas plottin' on 'em
Wrinkled ass tee, even though he got the iron on 'em
Hoppin' out of stolos, uppin' sticks like pogos
Tre pound and .44s, Algebra, he don't know though
Rob, rob, kick door, pray to god that this lick go
Serve raw indo, 20 deep at the Citgo
My shooters so young, they was born in the millennium
Get the job done, gotta problem, then they killin' em

[Chorus: Maxo Kream]
Got young niggas, young dumb niggas
Go young nigga, go dumb nigga
Got Crip niggas (cuh-rip), got Blood niggas (suuwuu)
Some real killers, some drug dealers
Got crash dummies, they blast with me
They'll stash for me, they'll crash for me
Go young nigga, go dumb nigga
Go young nigga, go dumb nigga
Got young niggas, young dumb niggas
Go young nigga, go dumb nigga

[Verse 2: D Flowers]
We the young niggas in the trenches that big brother just mentioned
Don't even post a picture with no money, we comin' to get it
I hit a lick on a sucka, you should've known something was fishy
I fucked that bitch and I blocked her 'cause she always up in my business
I took out that molar like a dentist, now I got her up in her feelings
On some ""Bad Boys"" Will Smith shit, I'm on a mission
Fuck the police when they hit the block, we gon' run for them bitches
I should've been in Olympics, the way I be jumpin' them fences
Fuck a detention, I rather fuck with suspension
Niggas been tellin' since elementary, I ain't fuck with no snitches
Hide and go get it I was hunching for bitches
Stealin' from teachers, shootin' dice behind the bleachers
When it come to the beef and the choppa make a nigga Turner like Timmy

[Verse 1]
My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, babe
And as I go my way alone
I find it hard for me to carry on
I need your strength, I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear
I miss so much

[Verse 2]
My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, babe
From this whole world I try to hide my face
But from this loneliness there's no hiding place
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell
In darkness with memories I know so well

[Bridge]
I need love now more than before
I can hardly carry on anymore

[Verse 3]
My world is empty without you, babe
Without you, babe, without you, babe
My mind and soul have felt like this
Since love between us
No more exists
And each time that darkness falls
It finds me alone with these four walls

Without you, babe, without you, babe
Without you, babe

And it's starting to drive me crazy

Here she comes in her hot pink pedal pushers
Bouffant hair from the Curl Up and Dye
Cat momma shades with a rhinestone customizing
Tell me I ain't one lucky guy
It's Friday night and full moon's shining
That always makes her just a little insane
It's eight o'clock and I hear them tires squealing
Picking me up in her purple Fairlane

There's a band at the rotary
Just a two dollar cover charge
Hear 'em playing as we're parking the car

And it's bang bang bang, goes the drummer
Twang twang twang, goes guitar
Dance dance dance, little Dixie
Oh and there go goes my heart

Never forget the first time I saw her
Chuck Berry playing while she walked the dog
Go-go boots and a leopard skin body suit
Beat 'bout anything I ever saw
We did the stroll and the double watusi
She never once let me catch my breath
She kept me going like a steam locomotive
Felt so good I liked to hurt myself

[Bridge 2]
Now 'bout each and every weekend
I watch her cutting up a rug
Every time I just fall in love

De Tiempo Adentro,Osiris Rodríguez Castillos,"

Yo soy un canto rodado
Siempre rodando canté
De tanto golpear de canto
Cantando me redondée

Quiero una copla que ruede
Cuando ya no ruede yo;
Semilla hermana del trigo
Del tabaco y del arroz

Panaderito de cardo
Que ande como sin razón
Sin que ni el viento se acuerde
De qué tallo era la flor

Quiero que ruede mi copla
Como la tierra y el sol
Lejano ya de la mano
Que acaso los redondeó;

Recuerdo que ande penando
Como un olvido de amor...
Abrojo que nadie sepa
Ni donde se le prendió

Sé de un rey en cuyas tierras
Jamás se ocultaba el sol:
Su reino se hizo pedazos
Pero su copla quedó

Polvo se hará mi guitarra;
Mi memoria... cerrazón;
Mi nombre, puede que muera;
Mi copla... puede que no

You're just a little bit older than I
We got our lives ahead of us, time to better us
But you turned 18 and moved out of your home
You had to grow up too fast on your own
Promise that I'll never let you down, I'll never leave you with...

We found god inside each other, leave your light on
Feet dark out until morning, it's my fault
And this where we are

We could live off love and go forth through them f**ked roads up ahead

We took it too far

But you're lookin' at me like I'm still a child
We got a lot to talk about, let's just talk it out
You turned 24 and you moved home back west
You left your heart in New York with your ex
Promised me you'd never let me go, how could you leave here?

O-O-O I still write songs about our winter days
Book our loss and found each other
Turn the light off, let the dark in for a while now, this I love

All you have to do now baby is pull on my heart strings
Let me know which way to go that's all right with me
Love me like a river darling I'll love you like the sea
Love me anytime at all cause that's all right with me
Well the night is tender and the night is long and I like what I see
There's a sparkle in your eyes like the stars in the sky and I know what that means
Oh anytime or anyplace wherever we may be
Well we're wild and we're young and we're free to love
And that's all right that's all right with me

So close your pretty eyes now darling put me in your dreams
In your world of fantasy that's all right with me

Well the night is tender...
That's all right that's all right with me

This World - NVK Remix By Vernon B.,Funker Vogt,"

For centuries and centuries
I walked along their battlefields
Rotten flesh and burned soil
Is all what they have left

A strange desire for destruction
Can be felt at all these places
An awful waste of resources
All for their killing machinery

A world all made of battlefields
A world all drowned in blood
A world which will not last forever
Is all that we have got

A world all made of battlefields
A world all built for wars
And now we take the battlefields
Far out to the stars

They get better year by year
With a frightening efficiency
Killing thousands in one strike
By pushing just one button

So I have been everywhere
From the jungle to the mountain
And even in the deepest sea
I saw the signs of a past war

Your Mother Was Right (For Gillan Fans Only),Gillan,"

This is called ""For Gillan Fans Only""
And it's just that: for Gillan-Fans only
And the reason, we decided to call the album ""For Gillan Fans Only"" was because, we wanted do something especially for Gillan Fans only, and so we thought it best to call it ""For Gillan Fans Only"", in order to impress upon you all, that the record is indeed for Gillan Fans only
It may seem unusual, even unnecessary to make a record for Gillan-Fans only, called ""For Gillan Fans Only"". But we felt, that for Gillan-Fans only a record should be made, free, for no money and at no cost at all, to Gillan-Fans only

Caperucita,Ismael Serrano,"

Caperucita sólo tiene dieciséis
Primaveras sin flores, papá le dice: ""Ven
Caperucita eres joven y tienes que aprender
A ocuparte de la casa, que serás una mujer

Para que seas buena esposa
Y no envejezcas sola
En la cama y la cocina has de saber
Alegrar a tu marido y cuidar a cada hijo
Que te atrapa tu destino
Que has de ser madre y esposa""
Y la pobre Caperucita llora

""Quiero volar, lejos de aquí escapar
Dime, mi bien, quién me llorará
Si me dan alas y echo a volar
Quiero dormir, no quiero despertar
Quiero ser la lluvia al otro lado del cristal
Quizás alguien me espere en la oscuridad""

Una fría tarde Caperucita iba
A casa de su abuela a llevarle comida
Cuando se encontró con un lobo feroz
Dime dónde vas niña, que te acompaño yo

La muchacha se supo perdida
Gritaba Caperucita
Mientras la devoraba el lobo
Bajo la falda del vestido
Estallaron los dormidos
Sueños que en la noche
La mantenían viva. Pobre Caperucita

""Quiero volar, lejos de aquí escapar
Dime, mi bien, quién me llorará
Si me dan alas y echo a volar
Quiero dormir, no quiero despertar
Quiero ser la lluvia al otro lado del cristal
Quizás alguien me espere en la oscuridad""

Una gris mañana Caperucita se casó
Vestida de blanco, bella como una flor
Su marido, muy elegante, otro lobo feroz
Y su padre orgulloso lloraba de emoción

Ahora cada noche el lobo la devora
Clava sus dientes, y llora
Caperucita mientras espera a que un aullido
Le diga que el dormido animal despertó
Después descansa tranquilo el malvado lobo feroz

La cara de Caperucita alumbra una sonrisa
Mientras mece una cuna. En ella está una niña
Quizás futura oveja para un lobo feroz
A no ser que afortunada la rescate tu amor

Caperucita la arrulla contra el pecho
Y un murmullo lento y lleno
De esperanza y vida
Canta Caperucita

""Quiero volar, lejos de aquí escapar
Dime, mi bien, quién me llorará
Si me dan alas y echo a volar
Quiero dormir, no quiero despertar
Quiero ser la lluvia al otro lado del cristal
Quizás alguien me espere en la oscuridad

Quiero volar""

[Couplet unique]
Un texte, pas d’souci, j’suis paré pour t’envoyer ça
Chez moi c’est dev'nu l’usine avec la paye du RSA
Et j’ai l’impression d’aimer ça, j’suis loin d’être difficile
J’viens d'là où on grandit seul, viens faire un tour et tu visites
L’ambiance est partie. Qu’est-ce qu’elle est belle, la France !
J’ai un million d’vues et ces trous d’balle croient qu’j’ai une vie d’palace
Et vas-y nique ta race, car il fallait bien qu’je l’sorte
Des rimes fortes, tais-toi non, c’n’est pas la rage que j’porte
Prose virale, reflet d’une attitude pirate
Aïe, viens voir ma ZUP : elle ne fait pas d’miracle
Grave, c’est l’chantier mais sans briques, des discrets aux indic’
Inscrits au Pôle Emploi en attendant un p’tit SMIC
Tout l’monde devant son stick, rien de fantastique
Tout l’monde devient tendu, une forme de gymnastique
De l’herbe dans l’plastique, argumente vos articles
Ici, c’est chacun ses règles, c’est pas une forme mais l'arbitre
Du béton au bétail, l’odeur d’la maille à c’Beckham
Du ghetto à Guetta, cherche à remplir le basstam
On a tous une vie à faire, vas-y regarde et valide
Y’a mes gars sur le terrain mais pas au Real de Madrid
Fuck l’État et son équipe ou leur couper l’appétit
Un peu oui : un sale mollard dans leurs spaghettis
Fini d’jouer, j’ai compris, j'ai mis d'côté l'Rachid
C’est ""Les Histoires"", et si j’reviens c’est pour casser la machine
Toujours en scred, si-si, et un message précis
J’ai des clips sans piscine qui tournent jusqu’en Sicile
On se fait p’tit mais si, j’vous laisse en haut jacter
Chacun ses griffes, dans c’métier, tu en verras gratter
Rapper tue, te rend tétu, joues-tu un rôle battu ?
Plus j’t’écoute et j’en peux plus en pleine période récup’
À l'aise, celle-ci elle t'éduque et vas-y lâche l’oreille
Lève-toi et montre leur comment travaille l’élève
Fais ta vie et mêle toi seulement de c'qui te regarde
Tu tomberas mais y’aura personne comme Spiderman
Fin d’mois difficile, problème invisible
Paye une facture et demain tu en as dix qui arrivent
C’est la vie, c’est ainsi, mais trop près des étincelles
Toujours les pieds sur Terre et même quand je monte sur scène
Si t’as un truc, va l’faire, n’aie pas peur de la perte
T’façon y’a rien à gagner : vas-y fonce tu vas perdre !
Non y’a pas d’racket et ni d’vendeurs d’lamelles
On connaît tous un gars qui r'veut l’casting d’La haine
Le parking est 3amar et les discours pareils
Avoir un flingue c’est vicieux, mais est-ce que tirer c’est malin ?
T’en sais rien, c’que tu prônes n’a rien d’un message
Et les seules fois qu’tu progresses, c’est quand tu t’es téléchargé
La barre est surchargée et toutes tes notes sont fausses
Pendant qu’tu t’inventes une vie uniquement sur Firefox
De 1, j'fais un boucan, de 2 j’te souhaite de rien perdre
Le 3 j’le fais tout l’temps mais j’n’ai jamais tué quelqu’un
À 4 parce que ça date, chaque histoire a sa raison
Ouais, grâce au hip-hop j’n’ai pas fondé une maison
Maitre de cérémonie, artisan à chaque saison
J’ai sorti juste un album pour mille et une liaisons
Le groupe, c’est les Grandes Gueules et pourtant on aime le silence
Tranquille, ça marche, on verra si l’projet sort en mars

Can't do trap music and boom bap
How they gonna tell me, what, i can't do trap?

Cats wanna dub like Andrew Jax
Mad cause the best don't hand you tracks
Take a step, let me handle that

When we in the club, motion pictures
I'm so fly
So consistent, stroke is vicious
Coke and mistresses less important
Knew they wasn't ready for my next recording
Mega forever keep the pressure on em

Droppin' bodies, cockin' shotties

No disrespect but I'm askin'
Where these cats get these accents
I'm wondering what happened
To crab scratches and backspins'
The rappin' is now past tense
And now it's all about trappin'
These has-beens straight graspin'
And yappin', tryna' make a buck
Actin, ain't lastin' no work so they change it up
Tell em the game is up
Plantin' my flag and i raise it up

And where will we be
Perhaps under a shrinkin’ Earth

No miracle gonna happen when you feel that way
Bent up but you gotta let it sway
No firecracker in the dark gonna light your way
Blown out but you gotta let it sway

Ti senti tremare

Che nella bianca schiuma vorrei perdere
Nel cielo son solo un pallone
Mentre le urla corrono
Scavando nel mio cuore
L'immagine di un tempo che non trovo più

Il caldo d'estate
D'un tratto arriva e tu non sai perché
Ti senti tremare
In quel bagliore sai che ti puoi perdere
Il mare con quel suo brillar
La spiaggia, il vento
Che ti porta il sale sulle labbra
Il mare con quel suo brillar
La spiaggia, il vento
Che ti porta il sale sulle labbra
Il mare con quel suo gridar
La spiaggia, il vento
Che ti porta il sale sulle labbra
E dentro l'acqua verde
Buttarsi in un momento
Poi mettersi a nuotare
Non pensarci più

After All,Dar Williams,"

Go ahead, push your luck
Find out how much love the world can hold
Once upon a time I had control
And reined my soul in tight

Well the whole truth
Is like the story of a wave unfurled
But I held the evil of the world
So I stopped the tide
Froze it up from inside

And it felt like a winter machine
That you go through and then
You catch your breath and winter starts again
And everyone else is spring bound

And when I chose to live
There was no joy, it's just a line I crossed
It wasn't worth the pain my death would cost
So I was not lost or found

And if I was to sleep
I knew my family had more truth to tell
And so I traveled down a whispering well
To know myself through them

Growing up, my mom had a room full of books
And hid away in there
Her father raging down a spiral stair
Till he found someone
Most days his son

And sometimes I think
My father, too, was a refugee
I know they tried to keep their pain from me
They could not see what it was for

But now I'm sleeping fine
Sometimes the truth is like a second chance
I am the daughter of a great romance
And they are the children of the war

Well the sun rose with so many colors
It nearly broke my heart
And worked me over like a work of art
And I was a part of all that

So go ahead, push your luck
Say what it is you've got to say to me
We will push on into that mystery
And it'll push right back
And there are worse things than that

Cause for every price
And every penance that I could think of
It's better to have fallen in love
Than never to have fallen at all

Cause when you live in a world
Well it gets in to who you thought you'd be
And now I laugh at how the world changed me
I think life chose me after all

I Went Outside Today (feat. Aesop Rock),Open Mike Eagle,"

[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
Yeah, I feel so fly today
Emerge from my very narrow heel-toe hideaway
My bad, like what people that steal old lighters say
I told the emperor to get real clothes right away
I'm focused enough to knit a whole sleeper quilt
And train tunnels moving through people like a Peterbilt
I found where all of my confident voices are
I'm feeling free 20 pounds on my oyster card
G'on 'head with my Dwayne Wayne looking ass
I want a stupid mic stand carved from a wooden staff
I'm tryna relive days that I couldn't grab
I looked up what Lena Dunham said and I shouldn't have
I don't know how I ever faced the odds
As a child I played grab-ass and shot paper wads
I matriculated up by the grace of Bob
Used to licks macrame, cricket, and decoupage
I'm tryna find true moments
Rick Martel's cologne can blind you Hogan
The American part of my mind's too swollen
If I was a font I would hate Times New Roman
I travel light like a choir can't
A modern satellite's equipped to spy on a fireant
Which is cool cause them fuckers is dangerous
I'm tryna learn to face –– FUCK!

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
Yeah, I feel so uppity
Peter Piper picked the purple stuff before the Sunny D
Summer pants, all of my receptors up and under siege
Itchy middle fingers triple lindy out of the ugly tree
Snap, Crack, show him to the closest blooming Onion
Reclusive Koopas moving out the dungeon into gundam
Money run along, sleeves up Tero on his upper arm
Sneak up on a thousand crows peppering the front lawn
Bite a bat's head off before doors
I'll forward you the recipe bork bork
Quarter and draw everything orbit a failing biosphere
Pioneer of pestilence my stylus is a science fair
The future primitive is skitching off the pace car
Rebel yell except for when he whistle by the graveyard
If I ain't home wiping spittle off the space bar
I'm tryna be the first jarred brains on a face card

You change yourself
Into something different for no one
Else's but the whole world's expectations

You dug yourself

So lose the shovel
You dug yourself

So listen here

Lean on this crutch
Or be trampled

This filthy world
Is what we are left with

Try turning this around

I just look back
At the filthy world
And I bow down

I Can't Sleep,Steve Young,"

Last night I stayed up late to watch the sunrise
It afforded a wonderful view
Count the sheep 'til I cry
Count the times you said goodbye
And I can't sleep when I can't sleep with you

There's no need to think you'd remember
A love like some forgotten I.O.U
I've been watchin' the dawn
Every night since you're gone
And I can't sleep when I can't sleep with you

Oh babe
I'm so lonely
Now I'm wonderin' what I'm gonna do
All of my life I've been dreamin' a sweet dream
How was I to know that dream was you

Count the times you said goodbye
And I can't sleep when I can't sleep with you

They say the game done changed
There's just some new players in it
And they don't wanna see my team get up there and win it
Try to keep me still but look where I'm at now
I made it too far to look back down
But I ain’t never ever going forget what I been told
And I ain’t never ever going back to being broke
‘Cause FYI
I stay on my grind
Tryna stop my shine
That day'll be never ever

[Verse 1]
I started out just a fan, writing like every other kid
Grew up to be the man, paying bills at my mother's crib
Everyday I'm hustling to get us out this situation
Got to deal with phony shows, groupie hoes and niggas hating
Mostly ya’ll embrace the small percentage of my city, racist
Instead of doing good, they'd rather see me catching cases
The fans love me but I struggle trying to impress the label
And all this got me feeling like it's way too much put on the table
I'm still smoking out of O
Some speculations cause I'm hardly ever home
Easy to say 'bout how we supposed to move on
When we going through depression and our brother O's gone
Was told you gotta go through hell to get the big thing
And when you feel it can't get worse, that's when shit change
Obama's president, The Steelers won the 6th ring
So I ain’t through trying, I feel like I can do anything

Big city, small town
Cause when your money's up, that's when they all 'round
But the minute that you slip, they dip
And it's no one to depend on when the chips fall down
Me, I never cut a corner short, I follow protocol
Got my focus on
Took my notes and all
This hard work gon' pay off
The second that I'm rich, I'll take the day off

If you out there on your grind
Put your hand up in the sky
Say “We grinding”
If you got it but you trying to get some more
Tell them boys “Yeah, we climbing”

Who know about struggling
Trying to get something
Cause we came up for nothing

You know the limit's the sky

When Julie showed up and took daddy away
The way that dress wore her, a fitting reminder... oh yeah!

Mom was so young, now she's feeling so old
No matter how she tries, she can't put it behind her

The smile on your face as you walked away
I remember the part where he left us forever
At the time I thought that it was the end
Can you remember how you loved me then?

She only did a disappearing act

For a phoney crime
She set her trap and played him for a fool

Where you get what you deserve
Thats the way of the world
Never thought shed have the nerve
Thats the way of the world

The plan has worked, theyre convinced shes dead
By far the best laugh shes ever had
But hes not amused
cause hes wrongly accused
Still he must admit she surely played it cool

Shes a villian in disguise
Thats the way of the world
Pulling the wool over his eyes

Blood Mantra,Decapitated,"

Through centuries leading their wars
Armed with crucifixes
Hardened with dogmas
Ravaging
Cursing
And murdering every Proteus

If you want me find me a faith not raised from ruins
Find me a god with non dirty hands
And I will be your, I will be your assassin, assassin
Eternal struggle, exchange of souls
Seven billions of souls and there is no free trade
If god is a ware who is the businessman?
Innocent merchant with familiar face
Is kingly trying to strike a bargain
Priceless
Currency
Salvation for sale
A unique offer?
Who likes fairy tales? [2x]
Instinct calls for destruction
Prayers will muffle their screams
Good lord will drink this blood
Every divinity demands sacrifice
Every sacrifice needs divine purposes
This is blood mantra
A universal rite, rite
Divided by symbols
Possessed by laws
Throats cut for power
Rebels choked on their blood
Temples carved in red stone
Altars from looted gold
Sanctification by slaughter
Absolution by doom
Saviours impaled on their thrones
The reaper's dancing around
Vicious circle rolls on
I see the cultures fed by the same earth breast
I see the races watered by the same earth veins
I see all the chosen nations sharing the same breath as me
I saw civilizations burnt their blood soaked into this earth
I saw gods raised from their ashes under different names
I saw devouring hate driven by fear of otherness, otherness, otherness

L'enfant qui dort - Public,Francis Cabrel,"

Laissez rêver l'enfant qui dort
Aux fumées bleues des châteaux-forts
Laissez-lui démonter le ciel
Dehors c'est toujours pareil
Le coin des rues comme des frontières
Et toujours penser à se taire
La ville encerclée sous le gel
Depuis c'est toujours pareil

Le temps malmène
Ces hommes qui traînent
Le poids de leur corps
Leurs phrases vides
Leurs larmes sèches
Leurs années d'effort
Les rues immenses
Où le givre s'avance

Et la patrouille dehors
C'est à peine si les pavés résonnent
Sous le pas lourd des moitiés d'homme

Les mains fermées sur leur colère
Les yeux comme privés de lumière
Peut-être un jour si Dieu s'en mêle

La pluie remontera au ciel
Vers nos immobiles remords
Mais c'est toujours pareil dehors

Le temps malmène...
Et s'il veut vivre longtemps
Surtout laissez rêver l'enfant...

Save It For Later,Splender,"

""So you're thinkin' about tomorrow
And all those simple things you think you might like
But you've been sipping in the daylight, you see
Well I've been trying to keep things light

So you're looking for approval
To do those stupid things your father might like
Well you might kill youself to get it, you see
But it might never make things right
It just might leave you more uptight...

And all the things within the world
And all the boys and all the girls
Who never seem to get enough
They save it for later, you see
All the saints and all the freaks and all the strange philosophies
The novelties and memories
They save it for later you see
They save it for later you see...

So now you're looking for some revelation
But you're still lying there, still in your bed
Well I've been spilling with emotions
But have you heard a word I've said...

So you're thinking about tomorrow
By reliving every minute of your past
Well I'm just living for the moment, you see
'cause I'm just trying to make it last
'cause I've just seen it go too fast

And all the things within the world
And all the boys and all the girls
Who never seem to get enough
They save it for later, you see
All the saints and all the freaks and all the strange philosophies
The novelties and memories
They save it for later you see
Save it for later you see...

And the best part of my life
Is the worst part of your day
And the best part of my song
Is the last part you ever play...

And all the things within the world
And all the boys and all the girls
Who never seem to get enough
They save it for later, you see
All the saints and all the freaks and all the strange philosophies
And everyone who never speaks
They save it for later you see

Then all the things within the world
And every boy and every girl
Who never seems to get enough
They save it for later, you see
Every time you build it up and put it in your paper cup
It never seems to be enough
You save it for later you see
You save it for later you see
Don't save it for later, you see

Maledetta ispirazione,Flesha,"

[Intro]
Guardami, salvami, torna con me… Lo sai

[Verse 1]
Il tempo passa lento e inesorabile
Senza te e peggio in questa valle di lacrime
Il dolore, l'inferno, le pene e la vita che mi stringe forte con le catene
Anche stanotte non ci sei, come faccio?
Passo, bevo un Disaronno con ghiaccio
Un po’ di frasi scritte e un flow marcio
Un'altra pagina che lascio e che straccio
La paranoia di non farcela più e di appendere il microfono al chiodo che sale più su
Guardo l'uomo nello specchio, un suono più vecchio e la musica mi uccide come Pierluigi Tenco
Ma no dai non posso essere io, nemico di me stesso mentre viaggio perso nell’oblio
Dio ridammi quella luce e quel tepore, c'è chi la chiama “amore”, per me è l'ispirazione

[Hook]
Guardami, mentre cado giù ti prego salvami, torna vicino a me
Parole perse nel vuoto, immerse nell'ignoto finché non ci sei te
Dammi un po' di luce, un po' di pace e riportami in là, dove c'è vita e c'è amore
Maledetta ispirazione

[Bridge]
Guardami, salvami torna con me… Lo sai

[Verse 2]
La luna che mi guarda ma non da consigli
Sorride beffarda, lo vede che non trovo appigli
La notte è bastarda, non dormo e non faccio sbadigli
La carta è bianca e i pensieri non battono ciglio
Anche se spengo la Tv ho versi passivi
“Music of My Mind” come Stevie
Dovrebbe essere spontaneo ciò che scrivi
Io mi ritrovo a contemplare il foglio senza feeling
Ho perso amici, donne, lavoro, ma tu sei il mio Eldorado, il mio mondo, il mio oro
Successo o insuccesso, è successo che spesso solo con te sono rinato e riemerso
Se non ci sei zero pace e zero relax
Torna da me, ti prego dammi un feedback
Dio ridammi quella luce e quel tepore, c’è chi la chiama “amore”, per me è l’ispirazione

[Hook]
Guardami, mentre cado giù ti prego salvami, torna vicino a me
Parole perse nel vuoto, immerse nell'ignoto finché non ci sei te
Dammi un po’ di luce, un po' di pace e riportami in là, dove c'è luce e c'è amore
Maledetta ispirazione

Our spirit is deaf
All the expectations
- wrecked sensations now
Illusions of intimacy
Split up the core

See me choke every promise we broke
As we grow old lost in decisions
Of greed and need - we shot our sense

Underneath the cemetery
I'm digging for any reason
As i breathe in i can smell
The stench of our inheritance
Split up the core

See me choke every promise we broke
Get me out, give me honesty
Give me space to breath

Hiding from the only northern star

From serving all the wrong gods

Travelled from the seven seas

Giving us a tongue to speak
Under murky waters we wander
With a dialect of faith
We face the many faces that our prism holds
Crystals from our youth
Carved out from our bones
Minerals from our ribs pouring from our bleeding side
Torn to be complete
Crawl down from your mountain

And I'll stay
As long as it takes
But if it took another road
To find another home
Just tell me

And a lie is just a lie
That only carries our shame
Yeah, we question our feelings
But at the end of the day
Still, you're all I want

But the half I got is the half I'm giving you

But the half I got is the half I'm giving you

Philadelphia Cop,Sun Kil Moon,"

Walking to my girlfriend's in Telegraph with a hand full of roses
Stopped through a corner store, on the TV a Philadelphia cop shot by ISIS
30,000 people murdered in the USA in 2015
And when I go in the studio later today we're gonna put up a mic and about this I might sing
See I don't give a fuck about things like who's the best or the worst on Twitter
And the other social media, money-making scheme turning you into a zombie
Jerking you off, masturbator, procrastinator
While the kids in Silicon Valley take your money and say, ""Can we get the check, waiter?""
While they bulldoze your favorite building in town and turn it into a fucking fruit shake maker
You got the brains to be the next Norman Mailer
You got the longevity to be the next Elizabeth Taylor
You got the class to be the next James fucking Spader
You got the swagger to be the next Stiv fucking Bator
But are you sitting on the toilet staring at your phone like a perfectly tailored, made-to-order puppet

I ain't no one's puppet, I ain't no one's puppet, I ain't no one's puppet, I ain't no one's puppet

I ain't no one's fucking puppet, I ain't no one's fucking puppet, I ain't no one's fucking puppet, I ain't no one's fucking puppet

Okay, so here I am, back home
I'm gonna read another chapter of this book, Beatlebone
The part so far that's made me the most smile is the page that has multiple uses, uses of the word ""wily""
That's me, a wily motherfucker
Come to Massillon and that's what you get, sucker
Gimme a one out of five, a big fat ten
Give me a two, either way it's all after me
And to all of you I say:

""Oh my god, you're a music journalist! Do you get to go to SXSW?""

""Yeah, pretty much every year. I mean, the magazine I work for sends me out there.""

""Oh my god, that sounds like such a blast.""

""Yeah, it's a lot of fun. I mean, it's super hard to get into VIP-after-show parties but, I don't know, maybe if you tag along I might be able to get you in.""

""Oh my god, you get to meet the bands?""

""Yeah, totally. I'm friends with Jim James, Dr. John Misty, a bunch of people. [notification sound] Hold on a second, Sufjan Stevens just texted me right now.""

""Oh, no way. I love him. So do you get to wear laminate?""

""Yeah, I mean it makes me feel a little self-conscious but, you know, you sort have to, you know, get into certain shows.""

""Oh my god, that's so cool!""

Let me ask you: do you own your own story
Being pimped the fuck out like a pay for a hoe
If you're a man in charge, claim you're a staunch feminist then give a woman your job or shut the fuck up
""Queen Bitch"" is a cool David Bowie song
And so is ""Rebel Rebel"" and ""Diamond Dogs""
Can you hear me to talking to you, Major Tom?
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

Should my girl be knocking
When we see each other everything's stopping
Yes who my girl be knocking
When we see each other everything'll be stopping

Oh, how I love her
Oh, how I love her

I'm watching Cocaine Cowboys Part Three
Girlfriend will be here at 7:00 then we're gonna go see a movie
Next week, got me a show in LA
Just had a nice dinner at the Elite Cafe
Walk to the movie and decide to skip our plan
Came back, turned on the TV, and watch The Falcon and the Snowman
All the way to the end, where they're walking side by side
Ankle chains in prison
And we watched a show on the Mongols with Lisa Ling hosting

Then we watched some shit about Satanists
Taking over Detroit
I gotta say, Detroit being taken over by Satanists was pretty soft stuff

Now it's 3:03 AM and the rain is pouring down
When I wake in the morning all I care about is that you're around
Now it's 3:04 AM and the rain is pouring down
When you're beside me, that's all I care about

Oh, how I love you
Oh, how I love you

Woke up, went to the studio
Came back and turned on CNN
David Bowie had died, there's a picture of El Chapo shaking hands with Sean Penn
Goddamn, like I said, we watched The Falcon and the Snowman the night before
With Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton
Bowie song played while the falcon soared
This isn't America, oh
This isn't America, oh

I woke up again, went to the studio and I
I tuck myself away
I sang a song in honor of my father
And I sang Roy Harper's ""Another Day""
The piano, just like the nylon string guitar
It makes me sleepy
And I find myself in bed early for me, about 11:30
Bowie's face kept repeating over, and over, and over, and over again
A video of one of my earliest heroes laying in a hospital bed
And more and more, Sean Penn shaking hands with El Chapo
That motherfucker killed ten times more people than Jim Fucking Jones
That motherfucker killed more people than that
Plus Waco
That motherfucker killed more people than that crazy fuck did on the Norwegian island Utøya and Oslo

Go back to the other part now
Go back to the other part now

As I probably took 5:00 AM, talk to a friend
Who'd met Bowie back in '97
The Bowie's fiftieth birthday celebration in Madison Square Garden
My first listen was during the summer between the second and third grade
I flew to see my grandma and my stepgrandfather down in LA
I played the song ""Young Americans"" over and over and over on the airplane
The song chugged along like a train, the backup singers wailed
And the saxophone sang
I'm in Room 214, Normandie hotel, Koreatown, Los Angeles
Me and my band played last night, we played David Bowie's ""Win""
I think we did it justice
And I talked briefly about the first time that I heard his soulful voice on that flight
I was among my friends and my fans and I got to sing
It was a really nice night
""Young Americans""
""Win""
""Fascination""
""Right""
""Can You Hear Me""
""Across the Universe""
""Fame""

Somebody up there likes me
And he was up on the eleventh floor
Watching the cruisers below
David Bowie was original and that's the part that spoke to me the most

Ooh, alright
Ooh
Ooh, alright
Ooh

Just back from a play starring Rainn Wilson
Thom Pain (Thom Pain)
He pulled it off brilliantly and tomorrow I'm getting on a plane (getting on a plane)
Now I'm back at home, reading Beatlebone
6:29 AM (6:29 AM)
A work of fiction sorta based on John Lennon
Running from fame (running from fame)
But now I'm at home, stayed up late
Waiting for Deontay Wilder to fight (Deontay Wilder to fight)
I was so tired from the show and the construction at the hotel that started when it got late (when it got late)

But more gonna die this year, it's around the corner

And I stayed up late that night, locking night out
Working like a worker bee (working like a worker bee)
Then when day, Lord, I watched the Marlon Brando documentary

And it's 4:36 AM
And the rain is pouring
And tomorrow, like always
I'm gonna be recording
And it's 4:37 AM and the rain is pouring
Tomorrow's gonna be another fantastic voyage

The Limit As X Approaches Girlfriend,Evan Edinger,"

[Verse 1]
If your love's x and f(x) is a function than you can't love more than one in conjunction cause that would mean your original love wasn't true
I wish that x belonged to me, but sadly I is not a subset of we ‘cause we returns the null set when it relates to you
I loved this girl and she loved me too, but she was always tangent to some dude who would rotate her head around the z axis when he walked by
So while he's over there tangent to her curves, I'll be mopin' round here cause I ain't got the nerve to tell her how I feel; no, I don't wanna be that guy

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could invert that graph on her face
That downward facing parabola
She'd take my hand; we'd get out of this place
But I can't ask her out because

[Chorus]
She's my limit as x approaches girlfriend
It's like this function never ends
Even if I wait until infinity
I think that we'll just stay friends

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If I plotted my love for her on a graph it'd be irrational, discontinuous, and half of the love I could give her if only we went out
But no matter how hard I try, I'll never be the cardioid of her eye; this love of our just seems so asymptotic
If you count up all the nights I've cried over her because I couldn't optimize her function has way too many constraints
Her solution is so unbounded that I'm pretty sure that it can't be found and if it could well I just can't do it by hand

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x 2]

[Verse 3]
When the time finally came, she sat me down and said:
“Listen Ev, I'll explain it terms that you can understand
You really are such a great guy
Another variable can't be hard to find
We may be like terms, but I don't like you like that
Before you get the chance to cry
Know that I love you
But the love you thought we had
Was imaginary”

Woah!
My love was not real at all it was the square root of negative one!
Woah!
This limit does not exist! I've come undone!

She was my limit as x approaches girlfriend
If only I'd checked the domain
As t approached 18 she diverged completely
And ever since she hasn't been the same

Speedway at Nazareth,Mark Knopfler,"

After two thousands came thousands and one
To be the new champions, we were there for to run
From springtime in Arizona, 'til the fall in Monterey
And the raceways were the battlefields and we fought 'em all the way

It was in Phoenix in the morning, I had a wakeup call
She went around the without a warning and put me in the wall
I drove at Long Beach California with three cracked vertebrae
And we went on the Indianapolis, Indiana; in May

Well, the Brickyard's there to crucify anyone who will not learn
I climbed a mountain to qualify ran flat through the turns
And I was down in the might-have-beens and an old pal good as died
And I sat down in gasoline alley and I cried

Well we were in at the kill again on the Milwaukee Mile
And in June up in Michigan we were robbed at Belle Isle
Then It was on to Portland Oregon for the G. I. Joe
And I blew off almost everyone when I my motor let go

New England, Ontario we died in the dirt
Those walls from Mid-Ohio to Toronto they hurt
So we came to Road America where we burned up at the lake
But at the Speedway At Nazareth I made no mistake

Christmas hopes and joys
Christmas puddings rich with Christmas creams
Christmas presents shine in the Christmas windows

Wondering what's inside, what delights they hide

I suppose that children everywhere (everywhere)
Will say a Christmas prayer

Pour le meilleur et pour le pire
Marié aux tours et aux remparts
Dans le passé comme à l'avenir
Jusqu'à ton ultime soupir et que la mort vous sépare

Tu te fais vieux c'est violent
À tes yeux et puis fais pas semblant
D'ignorer tes cheveux blancs
T'es trop intelligent pour entrer dans ce mauvais plan
Il faut raccrocher les gants
Rétrocéder les clefs
Avant de déposer le préavis à mon avis
Et s'il te reste un bout de vie
Tente de pas le bâcler

Ce serait humiliant qu'un enfant te mette ta raclée
Te laisse par terre les yeux mi-clos, ensanglanté
Trop heureux d'avoir taclé le grabataire et de s'en vanter
Honteux et édenté, tu 'rais quoi ?
Quitter l'enclos en attendant que les choses se soient décantées ?
Tu l'as assez répété, qu'on t'a un jour respecté
Que tout petit déjà t'étais un vrai déjanté
Mais maintenant faut avouer
Que t'as plus vraiment la santé
C'est sur toi qu'on essuie plaisanteries et méchancetés

Pour le meilleur et pour le pire
Marié aux tours et aux remparts
Dans le passé comme à l'avenir
Jusqu'à ton ultime soupir et que la mort vous sépare

Alors, pourquoi rester ?
Comme si tes pieds étaient lourds et lestés ?
Posté là, avec pour passe-temps
Le gain du marathon des siroteurs de bouteille
Tapeurs de carton, je te parle pas de métier
Qu'est-ce que tu me réponds, y a une marge entre le néant et le boulot complet-veston !
Et puis tu peux quand-même protester sur tous les tons
Ceux qui ont le temps de t'écouter n'ont pas de poil au menton
C'est la pure vérité de nos tours de béton
C'est le coup de karaté, le retour de bâton
Ton repos mérité à l'arrière du peloton
C'est simplement d'arrêter toutes tes conneries, tonton
T'as quarante ans garantis
À l'écriteau t'es limité à des coups boiteux et vu comme un mytho
Avant on voulait t'imiter
Maintenant t'éviter
Comme l'ancien vantard que le mitard a trop vouté
Et tu traînes avec des petits qui te prennent en pitié;
Serrent des mains et le lendemain appellent ça l'amitié
Tu n'as aucun bastion, encore moins d'équipier
Tu n'es qu'un pion dans un guêpier, un soldat de papier
Tu la connais l'histoire, c'est toi l'expert
Tout voyou doit rejoindre un jour son vestiaire
T'as bien eu quelques moments de gloire et quelques faits de guerre
Mais t'es plus qu'un pilier de bar imbibé de bière

I thought it would make me feel
It turns out that nothing magical happens in a pill
Now I’m saying all these things that I don’t mean
Is this really who I want to be?
I took something at a music festival

What’s gonna make me feel something?
I just wanna feel something

[Verse 2]
I drank something at a club in Mexico
I thought it would make me feel
It turns out that no amount of tequila could make me heal
Now I’m giving out my number to anyone
How many more shots till this night is done?
I drank something at a club in Mexico
But it didn’t do shit for me

[Chorus]
Now I’m trying to get high
Just to get by
I’m so sick of feeling nothing
What’s gonna make me feel something?
I just wanna feel something

[Bridge]
I’ll keep trying something till I fall down
Something till I fall down
Will you let me fall down?
No one wants a loser for a lover
Get myself together
Think I’m getting closer

[Chorus]
But today I’m trying to get high
Just to get by
I’m so sick of feeling nothing
What’s gonna make me feel something?
I just wanna feel something

Just the thought
Of our bed
Makes me crumble like the plaster
Where you punched the wall beside my head
And i try
To draw the line
But it ends up running down the middle of me
Most of the time

Boys get locked up in some prison
Girls get locked up in some house
And it don't matter if it's a warden
Or a lover
Or a spouse
You just can't talk to 'em
You just can't reason
You just can't leave
And you just can't please 'emi was locked
Into being my mother's daughter
I was just eating bread and water
Thinking
Nothing ever changes
And i was shocked
To see the mistakes of each generation
Will just fade like a radio station
If you drive out of range

If you're not angry
You're just stupid
Or you don't care
How else can you react
When you know
Something's so unfair
The men of the hour
Can kill half the world in war
Make them slaves to a super power
And let them die poor

I was locked
Into being my mother's daughter
I was just eating bread and water
Thinking
Nothing ever changes
And i was shocked
To see the mistakes of each generation
Will just fade like a radio station
If you drive out of range

Just the thought
Of our bed
Makes me crumble like the plaster
Where you punched the wall beside my bed
And i try
To draw the line
But it ends up running down the middle of me
Most of the time

Baby i love you
That's why i'm leaving
There's no talking to you
And there's no pleasing you
And i care enough
That i'm mad
That half the world don't even know
What they could have had

I was locked
Into being my mother's daughter
I was just eating bread and water
Thinking
Nothing ever changes
And i was shocked
To see the mistakes of each generation
Will just fade like a radio station
If you drive out of range

My Life (feat. Ceekay Jones),Bliss n Eso,"

[Verse 1: Eso]
Pop this tape in the deck, place the key in the ignition
We won't wait at no red light, only green's in my vision
Yeah a journey to the mind again, all aboard the brain
These feathers make me levitate in waterfalls of paint
Keep your fortune and your fame, mate, I'm chilling on a tree branch
Laughing at the squares, drawing perfect circles freehand
We kill the doubt, the path divine is limitless
My rhyme is the reason that they can't define the pyramids
Travel at the speed of light with Ceekay Jones
With full faith of where this freeway goes
A spectrum of colours, it's like our time has come
To ride high till we fly to that rising sun

[Hook: Ceekay Jones]
Baby it's a new day, driving on the throughway
All I see is bright green lights
Forget what you would call me, know that shit ain't for me
I'ma just live my life
My life, it's my life, it's my life
I do what I want, I do what I want to do
My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life
I do what I want, I do what I want to do

[Verse 2: Bliss]
When I wake each day, it's like a new timeless moment
The chance to steer your drive as soon as your eyelids open
I bush bashed a path that tipped the scales
And made it to the sea in time to catch my ship that sailed
Played the game my way, with my mind in the zone like Michael
Recite my diary like I'm flying on a motorcycle
The Easy Rider on that road that stretches nations
Life's speeding up and all I feel's acceleration
With that wind in my face and I got that past to my back
And I got that prize in my eyes and I got my passion intact
So I ride through the night and dream bright into the cosmos
Now all I see is green lights at every crossroads

[Hook: Ceekay Jones]
Baby it's a new day, driving on the throughway
All I see is bright green lights
Forget what you would call me, know that shit ain't for me
I'ma just live my life
My life, it's my life, it's my life
I do what I want, I do what I want to do
My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life
I do what I want, I do what I want to do

Baby it's a new day

It's my life
Baby it's a new day

Baby it's a new day, driving on the throughway

Firebird's Flight,Against Myself,"

Born from the sun he flies over the dawn
Where he drinks the dew that the world gives
His plumage revives the chilly day
Heard is his song (x4)

Looking down, generates tears
To heal the pain of the world
While building the nest of his setting
Every five-hundred years he reaches it
Heard is his song (x4)

Time came established, heard is his crying
With stars his sacred history is completed
With his wings fanned the fire
His courage was thrown inside
From his own ashes so revive
And firebird’s flying is undertaken again

Baby Im a trend setter
Took some time off to get better
Now when I aim, my shots dead center
No errors
Holding nothing back I open up like a sent letter
Cuz i been holding all this weight like a pallbearer
Big balls, but Im god fearing
This is the new me
This is a new era
Baby this is self improvement
They slept on my shit
Okay cool
But if they sleeping on this I chalk it up as foolish
Friends hating but I always knew it
That's why I say for every 10 niggas gain my trust 9 lose it
That's why Elzie keep the parabellum in the uzi
And Lew is not a shooter but can surely use it
You call'em haters I just call'em losers
Cuz stagnant niggas hate to see the boy moving
Headed straight to the guap
Cinderblock on the gas boy it's too late to stop

Got this money on my mind I'm fucking Walking profit
Cash cow for the city

All this heat got'em sweating like they running long distance
Like a bride and groom mothafucka im committed to the grind ima shine do you see the lights hittin, ima

Don't let me talk to your bitch or she gone slob on the dick

And when I get down
I get down here in LA
All the way to (NY NY)
And when I parley
I parley here in LA
All the way to (NY NY)

Touched the Iceberg baby
I'll send you under like the Titanic
Gun fight romantic
Gigantic on the pages
Of the hustler trade
World reknown for my realness
Only the real will feel this
Stainless steel is
The straps that I'm copulating
Touch'em a lady (?)
Blow your hand off
African stand-off
The general
Ice the hardest mineral
Feel me, a gem correct
One thing that I got you'll never get's respect
I stick the pits on ya
I represent California
Home of the shooters
The looters
The drug movers
Girl barracuda
Set you up for the kill
Where you're really not ballin unless you got 10 mill
I shine so bright I blind ya
Cross my crew, we'll find ya
It's a motherfuckin shame
My dominance to this game
I live for gun smoke aroma
Mack yo' bitch into a coma
Two hoes like Noah of every type
Bitches I kick to curbs, you would make your wife
Twice hit by the gun spit, kid still breathing
While half you busters in this damn game are still teething
Believe it if you say it enough that you'll be it
You never lived none of your raps, or even seen it
I mean it, every word a brother say
Everyday a brother play, kid
I politic and parley
The fact is I practice
Camoflauge to this
R & B androgynous
Get the most play
So I get fly
Do a movie - quadruple my cash
You just went double platinum
Let's see if you last
Every word that I say is documented and repeated
The truth is, I dropped the raw game, boy believe it
I've succeeded, in turning dirty dough legal
Bounced to the Bentley from the prime-it-up Regal
Like Biggie says, It's unbelieveable
My street pull
You even play like step in my way
You'll meet my people

Chorus

I've been round the world ballin, did it all, what's next?
While most of y'all busters on your first rolex
Been deep in the life kid, since 76
Touched the water, the crack game, the jewelry licks
Fix yourself if you're broke fool, that ain't my fault
The game must be taught and comprehended, then implemented
Moves done illegally, carried out strategically
Or else incarceration is felt, the hand is dealt
You lose it's frightening
Hit with 10 indictments
Kiss your baby and your wife
You're riding kites for life
Alot of y'all won't feel me, but some of y'all do
I'll move at least a half a mill of this before I'm through
That ain't the most, but I've done this longer than you
Plus it ain't my only gig, I'm still connected
With the boys that can flip a thou to a ticket
Wicked
My stature when you're in my rapture
Meet me on the street? I'm the nicest brother you meet
Confusing sometimes, the way I bust a rough rhyme
You might think I'm lying, cool I like that
I smile in your face, squeeze off the case, rock the Glock back
In your stomach, then I'll smile again
Don't want to be your enemy, I'd rather be your friend
Only the real win in the game, but what's the prize?
Every man goes through mad drama, and every man dies
Look in my eyes, touch my soul, I ain't like you
The evil I've done, I've got lots of retribution to do
That's an impossible task, cause every night the gats blast
So I look to the sky and ask
I've been blessed by God to rock this mic hard, so I do it
You got a problem, work through it
I love New York night, bright lights and action
I love bailin with my Bronx niggas, party crashin
I love switch hittin with my niggas on the shaw
You might see me in New Orleans at Mardi Gras
Or Miami at the Lex, in the Oaktown live
Or in Chi-town at the Players Ball, true P.I
Pimp or Die, Ice baby, it's a well known fact
That true players play the whole map

And we play all the way to (NY NY)

Walk You Down,Basia Bulat,"

Anytime that you ask for me
With a promise you can never keep
If you know devotion is hard to see
You're never looking for your crown
But it's there every time you're near me
Now I know that I love you dearly
And you know the ending better than me
It's all tied up in my hair like the prettiest song

And the day you fall apart
If you're not too proud, will you walk me down?
When I've been so lost
And if I never give you up
If I'm not too proud, oh I'll walk you down

If you never turn your mind on me
Where the chapel in your eyes had been
If you know devotion is hard to keep
And you can only let it go
But it's there anytime you're near me
Oh I know that I love you dearly
But you know the ending better than me
You're hanging me in your crown, where I don't belong

And on the day I fall apart
If you're not too proud, will you walk me down?
When I've been so lost
And if I never give you up
You're not too proud
Oh I'll walk you down

But if it seems dark, if I say that you're mine
If all confessions were enough, dear
If I only knew how
I'm still there tied up in that crown
On the day I fall apart
If you're not too proud
Will you walk me down?
Well I've been so lost
I never want to give you up
But I know I'm found
Oh I've heard it now
Oh, I'll walk you down

She's sniffing the night
His arms in the air
She follows the light
He's already there

She lights up a cigarette
He sings her a song
She likes to forget
He helps her along

And we wash their hair
And we test their eyes
It must be like Strangeways
Is living inside

She peels from a leaf
He circles the stars
She picks her teeth
He stares at the cars

The man from England said
There's no sign of bodies
The man from England read
Let hope be on their side

She pours him a Coke
He opens his heart
She tells him a joke
They're forever a spark

And we let them in
And we take them out
We're watching their progress
One day they'll be out

[Hook]
In the heart of the city where we were raised
Can't be afraid have to be brave can't show fear
Or emotion
Show nothing

[Verse]
I hated school I hated rules
Hated all my teachers, hated all my principals
Well not all, I guess one didn't try to play me
She thought I was smart I guess she was going to save me
But when you try to save the world it makes you crazy
That's why I don't blame her for giving up
Especially on a nigga that clearly just doesn't give a fuck
Cause in my heart I already knew my fate would precede my lifestyle
And that I might die behind a gate
Because a life of crime only takes you two places
Yeah two places where you don't need no suitcases
Looking back at it moving in a few phases
It's hard to pinpoint life in these confusing ages
When childhood stops and manhood beings
Child born in the wild smiles all pretend
If a child of the wild smiles just to draw you in

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Show no fear waiting for your ass to jump
Carry my gun everywhere like it's my asthma pump
But the only difference is it takes your breath away
So my advice is that you should walk away
And if there's no compliance
Well there's really nothing left to say
It's crazy how much hatred
We have for one another
When I buy a gun I buy it for my brother
Not as a gift but incase one of my brothers wanna
Start actin a little niggerish in a disrespectful manner
Well then I got the hammer to hit him with
Cause you can't show weakness
When you in the guerrillasness
Is this the jungle, or the neighborhood that I grew up in
If it's a jungle, pass the ammo get to bustin
I'm sure it's planned by someone who finds it interustin'

My brain has my heart inside the full-nelson

Low and behold is my crutch
Caught in-between making a difference and not giving a fuck
I'm at [??] in a pool with a [[crayon??]] on both arms
Tired of playing a fool blind in search of shelter from harm
I'm a flower surrounded by piece of weeds on the lawn
Allergic to the rays of the Sun, but I'm leaving at dawn
I'm gone, leaving behind all the pressure and pain
All the aggression and oppression that I try to withstand
All the negative thinking that's leaving a void in my brain
All the liquor, all the weed wet pills and the cain
I'm profane and strange accept it and love me the same
I'm a work of imperfection from the vessel I came
Easy for me to play it out but it's hard to explain
It's hard making out the line between my pride and my shame

A story not heard in the bright palace light
Can only be told as a secret of night

From a Knife to a Lantern and back, back again
She closes her eyes and weaves wonders
They hang in the air, hold my breath like a hunter
The girl in the garden and I

The stars in their courses will run
And bring their hearts earthward to hear her
The boughs of the fruit trees bend nearer
To the girl in the garden...

The fear holds us both in its hand
With every tale on my ear, it comes nearer the shore
We both dread the day when the words fall away...
And a demon will judge her
Then I fear that my dear will be gone
Shed a tear for the girl in the garden
For all of her years in the garden

A Death Sentence Called Life,Coffinworm,"

The seeds of malice indeed bear bitter fruit
We are all too familiar with the taste
Lying lifeless, dying nameless, disintegrated
The genesis of irrefutable magick
The dawn of imminent defeat
And the gnosis of their disparity
I witnessed that graceful tumble:
The only thing harder than watching
Was looking away, united only in the end
End and good times synonymous
In the mind of the unwound
The kiss of nothingness cries itself to sleep at night
While we live out this emptiness
Beholden to the concept of potential bliss
This disease plagues us all, as we embrace... downfall
-Jacob's verse, his words-
Empty words, faint echoes of nothingness
Patience drained into darkness I possess
Life of despair, leaving nothing for you
Death in the air, stench of reality breathing
Through smashed face, eternally crushed
Beneath the flood, I wait and rot for all to see
Taste of blood within a noose that's conquering
Chained throat, ripping my skin with broken glass
Black as pitch

Time,Mr. SOS,"

""Time ... Time ... What is it?""

[Hook]
""Time ...""
People wait for it others hate all of it and many waste all of it
Time. I need to know, ""what is it""
And when it's yours what will you do?
""Time ...""
Don't lose track of it
Let it pass you, kid
Or you'll find out what's after it
""Time."" I need to know ""what is it""
Cause mine might be long overdue

[Verse 1]
Spare a minute of your time to sit and listen to a rhyme
About decisions in your life that you choose
There's this kid, they call him Byron and he misplaces his lighter
And his bills are past due so he's screwed
No ambition left to find, he sleeps until it's five
Feeds his body mad brew and fast food
Gets back too late to say hi to dad, so one day father gets mad
And tells him what to do, he's gotta move
Now he's confused, walking down the street without any shoes
And he's starting to look more skinny too
What more can he do?
He's clueless, begging quarters for food
But he's content cause that's all he's gotta do, what a fool
He should have kept better track of minutes and dollars he used
Then he could probably do whatever he wanted to
But he acts like he's trapped right where he is and he can't fight
Destined to live a bad life, but do you believe that?
Cause many don't, including his dad
Who finds him in the back of a restaurant rooting through trash
He scoops him up fast and shoots him back to the pad for brunch
Prefaces his lesson with, ""I'll only tell you once
What I'm gonna tell you now. Don't no one around
Give a fuck about your luck they just don't want you in their town
Time waits for no man."" Byron replied then
""That might be true but every man woman and child waits for-""

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Second story's about an attorney who's on a journey
To feed his wife and child that was born prematurely
Tis the season to worry like always
For no reason cause everything due is all paid
But can't let a song play without some interjection
Becoming restless when they're running late and had nothing for breakfast
An hour late to meet the parents the mother could no longer remain calm
But just who do you place the blame on?
The same song reloops and they never stop and listen
Feeling like each day doesn't have enough hours in it
But at any given they're dealing with million dollar digits
If that's how I was living do you think I would complain? No
But back to the show with me
A rough day at court quickly turned to getting more tipsy than Nicole Richie
Rolling swiftly after boozing and cruising on purpose
Ended with the Sheriff asking ""Do you have proof of insurance?""
The answer was yes, but then he breathed a flammable breath
And the officer saw his new passenger sweat ...
""What happens next?"" Wait. Look at his license. His name is Byron
Looks like he took some advice and didn't like it
And would almost rather be back with no food on the street
Now look and see cause Byron lives in both you and me
Trusted judges among us, even brothers who lie
To survive look inside for the right balance, and you might manage

As a monarch you have grown
To expect more for your own
And every step you fake
Is to secure this fate

You’re destined to be
A doll on its knees
Following an aged plan
From your silly elitist clan

Did you really think you were the promised child?
When did you realize you couldn’t choose the path?
Following the footsteps of your legacy
You start to drown in a perverted sea

All hail to the empire’s doll!
The one watching who minds us all

Your deceitful speeches induce fear
In the elders and the meek
When lies turn to truth
Through your distorted point of view

With your gentle look hiding
Your addiction to power and greed
When your order takes it all
And ‘vampires’ us all

Did you really think you could fool us all?
That the play would really establish the norm?
A new generation awaiting for thee
For they see what you have not yet seen

All blames to the empire’s doll!
The one who enslaved and fooled us all!
Damned cult!

Bust down the Rollie, too many adjustments

Froze like the North Pole, bag like Santa
Walk in this bitch and I'm lit like a candle

Diamonds on me dancing like a real deal stripper
Bust in her mouth, you a fool if you kiss her
Diamonds on me dancing like Chris Brown
You said I wouldn't make it, well, bitch, I'm the shit now
Little bitch, sit down
Kicking in your trap with the chopper, better get down
Hoodrich Pablo on the jet with a whole pound
Young rich nigga, money long like a Greyhound
Blue money on me like the wave, too
Fell in love with the Lamb, had to buy two
Oooh, look how them diamonds dance
Flexing on them, hundred racks in my pants
Rings on me, that's water
Rich nigga, I was riding in the MARTA
Diamonds on me and they cut like a barber
I'm flexing on them in a 'Rari, no charger

I tried to hide from you
But I failed
I tried to lie to you
But how I failed
And even in my darkest time
You gave me light
I never knew this kind of love
Could feel so right

When I'm in your arms
I find myself believing
We could be anywhere
So I can keep on dreaming

You're like the sun
You feel like the sun
And everyday you're telling me
I am the one

Who makes you shine

And I know
Whenever you want me to
I'll go
And even when you're not with me
I feel you there
I'll only have to look and see
And I'll know where

When I'm holding you
The world can stop its turning
You're always gonna pull me through
And I won't be returning

Поцелуй меня красотка и потяни меня на дно
Будь для меня густейшим дымом, ага поехали в кино
Под джаз налей в бокал вино, фонарь как нимб на нашем фото
Где я обнимал тебя, а ты хотела допить колу
Не я не выйду на работу, тут сладкий воздух
Кубик льда, растаял на твоих губах, когда ты кушала морожку
Дай мне отдышаться, ха, купидон засел в фонтане
Ожидаешь много лайков, я дарю тебе свое
Мечтаешь о хорошей жизни, наша жизнь и так кино
И но всегда тут есть, ало? скучаешь, что?1 д да я дома
Пошли выйдем на балкон, покурим, поболтаем, что?
Твои глаза глубокий омут, что заведет нас далеко
Постой, постой не торопись, наши тела светит луна
И виноградный водопад, заставит нас скупаться там
Валяться на земной постели, да мы Ева и Адам
На фоне звуки , о да ты чувствуешь что я

Нашел тебя, твои глаза, как самый черный виноград
И запах твой сведет с ума, ведь ты одна, да ты одна

Ну что за вздор, давай смеется, будем пить, играть в лото
Ты раздевайся, стало жарко, а я схожу за синим льдом
Покуй лишь платье, да все, мы будем так где тепло
Бунгало, море, белы песок, вино, шезлонг и куча пальм
Нас не найдут, не потревожат, лишь маяк в твоих глазах
Укажет путь куда идти, когда ты спрячешься, ага
Я каждый день буду с тобой, встречать рассвет
И строить замок, из песка, не много соли, еще лайм
Текила, пусть горит костер, ведь мы целуемся на заднем

I'm a rider on a wild horse in the canyon running through the night
I love that I have freedom in my soul and the way I live my life
But even cowboys need a lady's soft touch to help us settle down
But I love to hear the music in my heart and the way the highway sounds

I love being lonesome, but I dont like being lonely
I wake up in the morning and theres no one lying beside me
I love em and leave em so I'll never find my one and only
I love being lonesome but I dont like being lonely
I've tried and tried a thousnad times to make it work but I dont understand
The difference in the feelings of a woman and the feelings of a man
I run away each time I get a chance to fall in love and it just kills me
I need to find a lover I can trust a woman who can heal me

Crypticism,The Man Who Never Came Back,"

Well There's music in the air
Lots of loving everywhere
So gimme the mic!

So I get cryptic, rip it, apocalyptic
Shit sticks when I kick it mystic
Check out this temporary multidimensional imagery
Being projected on your screen while you keeping it real
I break down
Hypothetical situations
During rhythmic conversations
That give birth to tangible manifestations
He, ha, Got these cats gawking while I creep
Up on you, coz your talking in your sleep
Like you walking around in your pajama
You better wake up or get ready for some drama
Yo, vat jou uit
Gaan terug na jou kamer
En bly daar my bra, totdat jy se ek's jammer
What you say?
Yo did I stutter mother fucker?
Its atmananda, Aka Silent Thunder
I speak into the instrument that converts sound waves into electrical waves
So enabling them to be transmitted
And ice foes with nice flows by sticking to the facts
Now you got the Max
Stuck in your head like an axe

Den de den den! ow!

No thanks, angi fumi nyama
But that's just me, you can do what you wanna
While I walk this earth eradicating my karma
Got some things to do then I'm onto Nirvana
Always got a smile for you like the Dali Lama
Isata masaganye indi siawa
Little fishy don't wanna mess with da piranha
When i get wicked and kick it like a chihuahua

Passop lightie!
Little dogs wanna bite me
It's the postman delivering the word of the almighty
You can't rock it, your balls haven't dropped yet
Yo when I drop, eyeballs pop out their eye sockets
Fuck it, did you just see what I saw?
Bring that lyrical kung fu shit, like ha-saw!
I'll give you my heart and my soul, but that's all
I got the sun in my face, that's why I stand tall
Dazzled, fucking up the fiasco
Like donnie brasco
With no hassle
Splashing my shit like picasso
It's like I'm on a hot date with my classmate
C'mon baby milk my prostate

Den de den den!

If a fish bite my line on a Sunday, I'm gonna reel 'im on in. (haha)
I Believe I'll take 'em on home, fry 'em up good an' have a ball....
‘Cause I don't see nothin wrong with fishin’ on Sunday at all. (haha)

I'm goin' fish-fish, fish-fish, fish-fish, fishin'
Boy, I'm goin' fishin', hook, sinker, an' line
I said, fish-fish, fish-fish, fish-fish, fishin'. (hahaha)
Yes, I’m a-goin’ fishin’ just to ease my mind

Alright!

I’ll take my pole and my jug, down to the river
Gonna sit up on the bank
Every time the fish starts to nibble
I’m gonna take me another drink

I'm goin' fish-fish, fish-fish, fish-fish, fishin'
Yes, I'm goin' fishin', hook, sinker, an' line. Woo!
I said, fish-fish, fish-fish, fish-fish, fishin'. (hahaha)
Yes Lord, I’m goin’ fishin’ just to ease my mind

Now see there, look at this big ol’ string of fish
Ol’ Charlie ‘n them tried to tell me I wouldn’t catch nothin’
Look at the catfish on the end. Woo! He’s a big one

I’m gonna get the whole neighborhood over here
And fry these up, sit ‘n have a good ol’ fish fry, yessir
Ooh, it’s startin’ to smell good already. Yessir

Hey, bust out a couple bottles a ketchup, salt’n’pepper
A couple a loaves of bread, an’
We’ll just have a time here tonight. Yessir

Get that old boy next door
To come play his fiddle for us…
Send ol Charlie Daniels out for a
Couple bottles of Corn Liquor, will ya
Aww, here he comes back with it…
Eh, hand me a tall glass, darlin’
And about two more a’ those fish sandwiches…
Woo, this sure is good…
I ain't had this much fun
In about a hundred years…

Oh I don’t know, you’re all or nothing, you either win or lose

(Make your throat burn more) The closer you go, the more you’re trapped
(Strong like alcohol) You just cannot have it, you’re in a trap
(Make your throat burn more) The place you need to be is a place that doesn’t exist, the Top
Why are things so one way or another? It’s either all up or straight down
A certain place, a certain way – that’s not the only way
You’re a pretty butterfly, the fact that you can fly is your treasure
You’re so busy crawling that you still don’t know yourself

Foggy Lilac Windows,Frontier Ruckus,"

The holes of highway bones are filled
But the tolls of highway loans are billed
To the board of directors of boredom, here

So I slept outside the worried exit
And hurried to avoid the decrepit
Hordes of fallen Lords, I can't afford'em, dear

But overwhelmed is a laughing word
To say you've taken for granted stillness
On an ever-moving planet

Was the glacier's falling heard
Was the crumbling porch's utter realness
Made of ash or made of granite?

Oh, I'm so longing for my mama's kiss
And scratching my old lifetime's back
That simpleminded tenderness
Is a pity that my searches lack

The graveyard breathes reality
But reality's blurred outside my gate
No matter if I hesitate
The foggy lilac windows come
And dumb my number one ambition
And it's too much repetition

The south was knee-deep in the weeds
And I was in a plank-wood parlor
Every flame from every mouth was only worth a dime

Feeling easier to move than shifting reeds
I was wearing my times on my collar
But my colors don't get bright in season's time

Your biggest grid did shrink and sink
In one night's walk of blindness
To foreign sites where bright lights find you out

When evolution is extinct
And lurking is a fossil's kindness
And there's no one left under our sun to sign you out

And the piano strings are damp and deep
And the honky-tonk is breaking free
And the second-grader that you keep
Beneath your skin is next to me

Ah, who likes, who plays these games
And who is clutching to the reins
'Cause I scurried open plains
And the foggy lilac windows come
And dumb my number one ambition
And it's too much competition

And that bleached canal was rare
And Ma was there
And no one dared to care (about tomorrow)
The road is bare
I go nowhere
And all the joy that I'm aware (is food for sorrow)
The loft upstairs is unprepared
The billboard fields are stoned in pairs
The gravel layers and river dares
And the air is very weary

Dirt on his hands

[Verso 3 - Rod]

Dizem que tô louco, que perdi a moral e a consciência
Que não sei medir as consequências, o processo é lento, então paciência
Quero uma mina com competência, se ajoelhou, não tem desistência
Se quiser pode chamar aquela sua amiga boa pra te dar uma assistência
Uh, enche meu copo ninguém aqui tá sóbrio e eu é que não vou ficar
Se tá achando que to malucão, tem que ver como eu vou ficar
Querem me internar, mas não vão conseguir
Me põe nessa porra eu consigo fugir
A culpa é do alcool eu não posso mentir
A mina tá nua e eu querendo despir
Eu, tô com os mais locão, só quero kadvo no copo
Mina vem servir, servir, que eu
To com os mais locão, preparado pra sessão, vem pra fuga, mina vem, vem

[Verso 4 - Shock]

Que eu, me encontro igual Saddam Hussein, mina
Junta nossos explosivo e faz um big bang, ainda bem
Tive que chamar o raul, urghl
Tava empapuçado já de cachaça pitu, fala pra tu
Nego adora me trancar num quarto sujo
Mas aos 47 do segundo eu sempre fujo, e nem me sujo
Não é que eu não goste, é que eu detesto
Abri fuga pela porta principal do pedro ernesto, eu não presto
É que vazo ruim não quebra, sangue ruim não coagula
Drogarias qshó, meu rap é sua bula
E é indicado pros doidão e pras doidona
E a contra indicação é ouvir som da madonna e ser cafona
E o manicômio ? as vezes me instalo por lá ainda
To com o quarto reservado, número 3.030

The Phone Call,Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver,"

Well when he got the phone call it gave him quite a fright
?Cause a call from home is rare enough especially at midnight
He answered kind of nervous, a voice said, ?This is dad
I was sitting here and thought of you and it made me really sad

?I know I?ve been a hard mad to live with in my life
You?d think that I just didn?t care ?cause all we did was fight
And you probably hate me more than anyone
But I still love you son

?That time when you were 14 that bully blacked your eye
We tracked him down and I made you fight until you made him cry
I know this worn out feeling the things that I?ve done wrong
That drove a wedge between our hearts and drove you from our home

?I made you give up football so you could bail my hay
I made you give up Jenny and then she got away
Any you probably hate me more than anyone
But I still love you son

?For all the love I never gave I?m sorry for that now
And for all the things I didn?t say I want to say somehow
But I guess I?d better hang up because I probably called too late

But if you could find it in your heart to forgive me that?d be great
But you probably hate me more than anyone
But I still love you son.?

And then he heard the dial tone and then his front doorbell
And his mother stood there all alone not looking very well
She said, ?I drove three hours ? didn?t make one stop
?Cause tonight your daddy passed away just before eight o?clock

?At first he talked about you like he ain?t done in years
And you might not believe this but, god, he cried real tears
He said you probably hate him more than anyone
But he still loved you son

?And he said, ?For all the love I never gave I?m sorry for that now.?
And he said, ?For all the things I didn?t say I want to say somehow.?

the birds - Live,Elbow,"

The birds are the keepers of our secret
As they saw us where we lay
In the deepest grass of springtime
In a reckless guilty haze

And they wove a sweet indifference
And it settled on our skin
Till the eyes that I remember
For the last time drew me in

The birds, though I wore your glacial patience
To a smudge of bitter dust
On the last day you embraced me
With a glistening sapling trust

Did they sing a million blessings
As they watched us slowly part?
Do they keep those final kisses
In their tiny racing hearts

What are we gonna do with you?
Same tale every time
What are we gonna do with you?
Come on inside
Looking back is for the birds

What are we gonna do with you?
Same tale every time
What are we gonna do with you?

Cause if you ain't - know, thugs and ladies go together
Poppin' my collar, patnah - who in the spot?

Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me cause they don't trust me
And they say I'm lucky; you think I got time
To blow all this dough and do all these shows?
Or flight in the llama chargin white Rolls

But I started losing faith so I’m filling my cup
See I really need your love when I’m broken and drunk

And still you try to tell me that it’s all in my head

I can tell you’re crying from The messages you sending
I need to be reminded all the shit that I’m Forgetting

Cause lately I’ve been trying to do everything that I can
I know I’m doing things that you’ll never understand
I really treated you like you were just another fan
And then again you’re not the type to give a second chance

Just know that imma be there if you’re ever at your worst
If you ever feel alone you know who you’re calling first
I hope you know I’m sorry for everything that it’s worth
We really love each other but it’s never gonna work

A Final Lament,Evig Natt,"

[Kirsten]

A final lament and you'll be gone
From my mind and soul
Banished to an eternity of silence
Echoing from all the walls
The most sacred of chambers
The last trace of you
Screaming at me, clawing and fighting
But my scarred flesh will hold
Numbered from all the pain
My walls, they will hold

This time no rose petal ground
For you to tread upon
This time no rose petal sheets
Cover my bed
This time no tears to drown the
Pain that burns your heart
This time it's you who yearns

You're alone

Can't you see that I'm your shadow?
I will never let you go
You are mine and you will follow
Fading are the days of old
Make me bleed; I'll make you suffer
Don't you think that I will fold
Your time will come as mine has now
You my shame, I'll take the pain
Your fear, your scars, I can heal them
All that you are I forgive
Your path will be mine, start walking
Their backs are turned, I'm all there is

I'm the silence that surrounds us
Seeping through our heart that burns
Don't look back, I'm right behind you
A song with no end, heat the hum

Scream... but no one will hear you
It dies inside your soul, you'll fall

Let My People Go,White Heart,"

I'm getting so weary
This cross that I carry is starting
To weigh me down
So far down
If this is the nation of toleration
Why must our faith be out of sight
And sound

If anything goes - then let me go my way
I wanna live my life for Him - so let me say...

Let my people go, let my people go
Let my people go
Oh won't you let my people go

Geraldo in waiting, media chanting
Alternative voices shout - God is passe
You don't have to believe in the things I
Believe in
But we'll watch the world and see what
Passes away

The choice is yours - you can roll the dice
Just let me live my life for Him - always

Let my people go, let my people go
Let my people go
Oh won't you let my people go

Stake our destiny in the land of liberty
This cross upon my shoulder is making
Me bolder
Makes me wanna shout ""let my people go""

Let my people go, let my people go
Let my people go
Oh won't you let my people go

She's a bad girl
Met her in a mad world
Says she wants to slow down
But this is what I told her, now
Hello ""Miss You-Fucked-Me-Over""
Got me looking over my shoulder
Telling me lies like I don't know the difference
It's no secret where you been
You ain't discrete while walking with him
Up in your skin, yeah I can see the fingerprints

So I went looking for my own something on the side

How could I ever be mad at you?
How could I ever be mad at you?
How could I ever be mad at you?
Cause I've been doing that shit too
How could I ever be mad at you?

How could I ever be mad at you?
Cause I've been doing that shit too

[Verse 2: Sean Foreman]
I got OCD when it comes to that pussy
Says she don't wanna push me, yeah
But this the way she took me
From a dream into a nightmare
I could see the devil - he's right there
Stumbled upon a pack of someone's cigarettes
In the backseat of your Honda
You can say whatever you wanna
That doesn't mean that I will think you're innocent

[Verse 3: Nathaniel Motte]
I'm all in it - past the limit
Knocking on the gates of heaven
Can I kick it?
I gotta find a piece of mind right now
Cause I'm losing my mind right now

So I went looking for my own something on the side
I've been living my life
I've been living my life, yeah

Whatcha Know About That,Willie D,"

Verse 1: [Willie D]

As I roll through the motherfucking inner city
27 years and the block still looks shitty
The mayor put his picture on my fence
Promised us a lot of shit and I ain't seen that bitch since
I'm bout to do a Frank Nitty
Cause the potholes fucking up the shocks on my new Chevy
Gotta Malcolm X 'em like Spike Lee
Cause they taking niggas in the hood lightly
Politicians just use black folks
They only come around when they want a motherfucking vote
And ain't no sense in you going to city hall catching fevers
You stand a better chance seeing Jesus
So I got me a plan
Steal me a Astrovan and take the law into my own hands
And I ain't going out talking to them hoes
(What's your objective?)
I'm putting blood on they clothes
Cause they don't respect niggas
Until we start shaking they ass and pulling triggers
And that's a Goddamn fact
Now what you so-called hard motherfuckers know about that?

Chorus: [Melanie McGee]
I wonder why life's a bitch, then you die
Same thing that makes you laugh makes you cry
Why judge that bro, cause you reep what you sowe
What goes around, come around, now you know

Verse 2: [Sho]
Little miss Jackie, she got turned out
Fucking with that glass dick
Little miss Jackie, she turning tricks
She putting her mouth on everybody dick
Hey yo Jackie, finest little thing in 12th grade
Jazzy haircut, Anita Baker fade
But I couldn't get the play or the time of day
Cause in life we was headed in opposite ways
While she was trying to reach the top
I was slanging rocks, drinking brew and dodging crooked cops
Used to give her my all
And every day in school a nigga got dissed in the halls
But it didn't take long for me to find
Every dog can't chew on every bone
Then some time went by
I heard through the grapevine, little Jackie was getting high
This I just couldn't believe
Not Jackie, miss most likely to succeed
One day rolling up the cut
I seen this fiend, pants all in her butt
I'm thinking to myself that's a shame
I stopped at the light she called out my real name
Stuck her head in my window said she needed help
I looked it was Jackie 'what you did to yourself?'
The devil ain't nothing but crack
That bitch small as a tic tac
What you know about that?

Chorus

Verse 3: [Willie D]
Now let's talk about Craig, a jockey and a dopehead
]From the time he could walk little Craig was misled
He had a freeloading stepdaddy, mama was a hoe
She sold her ass to take care of that Negro
He used to pimp her, and make her give him every cent
(And peep this, made her own kids pay rent)
Craig started jacking, bringing every dollar home
Got a gun and a screwdriver, fool got his hustle on
Crank your shit in a second
(And if you walk up on him, you better draw your weapon
Cause he'll put you to rest, and rest you quick
And wouldn't lose sleep) Not one single bit
Then he met this girl who became his wife
Bought a car and a crib, started a new life
'Til one day, riding with his family
He saw this nigga that he fucked back in the game, gee
He threw some dirt, the nigga threw it back
Dressed his family in black
Now what you know about that?

아침이면 풀 냄새나는 곳, 나의 고향
한 시간 걸리는 시내를 부지런히 오갔지
밤에도 뜨거운 여름, 여자들이 이뻐
Yeah, 난 살기 좋은 데서 자랐지
정확히는 다 모르겠고 딱 붙는 그거, 어, baby phat
여튼 이뻤는데 이제 지난 유행이 됐네

하는 식으로 걸어, 꼭 젓가락질 같았어

편히 음악하는 아저씨, 난 꽉 차있는 스케줄은 싫어해

밥 먹을 때마다 두 끼 정도가 돈 얘기
내 상식은 사람들 전부 일하고 놀고
근데 해보니 일하고, 일하고, 또, 또, 또, 씨팔
이건 절대 내 스타일이 아니지. Fuck 구인구직
I'm doing music, 예술로 살아, I'm an artist
빚쟁이 백수, 공사판에선 늘 초짜
난 화가 난 채로 채근하듯이 꿈을 쫓았지
그 느낌 어떤 건지 알자마자 관두고 닥치고 음악
나보고 니 새끼는 싹수가 별로라던 니 새끼말
씹으며 난 앞만 봐
그쯤부터 성격이 조금 변한 거 같다만
그 덕에 처음 구경해본 뒤로
6년째 돈 좀 만졌네
그땐 그게 크다 느꼈네, but

Imma lose it, here we go
I’m so crazy, Imma get on ‘em right now
Follow me, It’s my insanity talking
Yeah, I’m so crazy
You know what it is, why is it
I don’t give a fuck

[Verse 1: Claas]
Yeah, these mother fuckers still talking
Staring at a bunch of dead men walking
The commotion, it keeps my brain numb
But I'm about to just snap and then go dumb
Here we go, turn the lights off
Cause y'all don't really want to see me when the mic drops
And when the rhyme stop and when the fight starts
Bitch, I'm a big bear with a lion heart
Fuck them all if they hate me
Cause I don't give a fuck about them
Imma brush them off, Jay Z
I'm a little bit crazy
But at the same time people always tell me I'm amazing
That's all I'll ever be, and I love it
Mother fuckers begging, please, they can shove it
I’m not above it, my mind has gone nuts
I'm Lil Jon now, nigga, I don't give a fuck

They think they know me cause they know my name
Half the shit they say drives me so insane
Imma snap one day and you're all to blame
Now pause the game, buy some X
Start sipping on a 40 while you drive and text
All insanity, profanity, the lies are next
I'm just mentally insane and these are side effects

[Verse 2: Kasland & (Lil Tin)]
When the screws get loose and I lose it who's
Going to be there to stop what these illusions do
I'm elusive too while I'm cruising through
Every track that I do with a noose and two
Different voices in my head, could be caused by the sleep aids
Filled with medication, got me gone in a deep phase
Wake up in the mornings by the toilet with the seat raised
(Are you crazy?) Only on the week days
And I never thought about it
But I shout at everybody then my angers automatic
Like I barely get upset and I just lose control
Stop asking me to change before I lose it, oh
And you don't want to run up into someone in the place so
Well equipped with hellish shit and mentally erased, no-
-Body ever saw me ’til I caught up with the pace though
Now you want to say that you're a fan, if you say so

[Chorus: Kasland]
People all talk, but it's all the same
They think they know me cause they know my name
Half the shit they say drives me so insane
Imma snap one day and you're all to blame

All insanity, profanity, the lies are next
I'm just mentally insane and these are side effects

[Verse 3: Lil Tin]
Yeah, I'm crazy, don't fuck with me
Tired of dealing with these hoes
Fucking sick of y'all bugging me
Before these side effects explode (go and get it, mother fucker)
Tell me why you stupid bitches got to ask when I pass
Why can't Lil Tin just holler back, God, he's mad
Now I'm mad, I'm just barely sticking it out
Instead of my name we'll put my dick in your mouth
Say fuck you, fuck you, fuck you all
Oh this shit's a fucking game, what? You busting my balls
Man, this ain't the fucking card that you're wanting to draw
You're the reason why I cuss so fucking much in this song
I said now I'm getting really pissed off, add my withdraws
Anger's about to lift off, peaking to the tip top
Get off, I'm jumping like a tip off
Sick of all this shit, middle finger's up for lift off

[Chorus: Kasland]
People all talk, but it's all the same
They think they know me cause they know my name
Half the shit they say drives me so insane
Imma snap one day and you're all to blame
Now pause the game, buy some X

[Vers 1: Ken Ring]
Det är väl de utan jobb som inte har någonting
Som förlorade sin kvinna och sin ring
Som aldrig kunde köpa hus, som drömde om en bil
Och jag tog på mig mina kläder där i Hässelby
Och utan vänner, det var vi utan land
Finns inget jävla vapen de kan lägga i min hand
För man glömmer hur det doftar, när man tappat sitt tal
För de som tappat rösten, och inte har något val
Det är de som inte har någon lust att lämna mig ifred
Det finns människor, bror, som ingen jävel vill se
Och ni bor på mitt kvarter, svär jag lever för er
Ni som vet hur det är, att aldrig se något mer
Än de småsmulorna som de slänger där i hörnan
Ja, jag svär på vår bror för de döda han
Och jag vet att det krävs så mycket mer
Vi är de som bara gud orkar mer

[Refräng]
Vi lever
Vi lever
Vi lever
Vi lever
Vi lever
Vi lever

[Vers 2: Ken Ring]
Utan hopp och utan mat
De som inte finner skydd, de som inte har någon stat
Ja man jagar sina pengar, som man sårar sin familj
Vi är de fattiga som aldrig passar in
Och staten är som gamla hundar, lättare att blunda
Ett hinder vi vill runda, måste mätta alla ungar
Det är klart jag undrar varför mamman bär på påsarna
Känner hennes smärta när hon korsar genom gårdarna
Jag fäller tårarna, det känns som vi förlorade
Gick mot vårt öde, men ingen förstod att
Vi var på fel väg, det blev en lång kamp
Men när jag går för alltid håller jag min brors hand
Jag vet hur det känns att sova på en bänk
Att inte ha en spänn, jag svär man tror att det är ett skämt
Att inte vara svensk, och komma hit och ingen ser dig
Jag svär jag hoppas du är med mig

Dzisiaj jestem tym kim się stałem
Choć tak wiele z przebiegu spraw się nie spodziewałem
Teraz już wiem że po życiu spodziewać się mogę wszystkiego
W każdej chwili nawet w tej
Każdy dzień to kolejny epizod
Ludzie tak Cię piszą jak Cię widzą
Proste że oni kochają tak jak nienawidzą
Tu cienka linia jest granicą
Dbam o to by moja dusza i lico
Nie były tylko tym co pokazuje telewizor
Dla siebie mam swą prywatność mogę przysiąc
Czysta przyjaźń jest tu moją dewizą
Żaden schizol, od tagów trzymam się z dala
Wara, od Naszej Grupy bo podniesiemy alarm
Że by coś osiągnąć trzeba się postarać
Jestem tym kim jestem i gra gitara

[Ref]
Po dziś dzień - jestem tym kim jestem
Nie zmieniam się pod byle pretekstem
Owszem, każdy ma swoje jazdy
Przecież nie każdy czyn musi być rozważny
Dobrze wiem! do odważnych świat należy
Trzeba coś przeżyć, by móc w to uwierzyć
Licznik bije ja nadal żyje
Jestem tym kim jestem się nie kryje

[Pepper]
Pepper jak kto woli Pepperone
Ponownie stoję tutaj za mikrofonem
Choć każdy z nas podąża w swoją stronę
Wciąż puszczam z dymem to co zabronione
Po dziś dzień bity, kartka i ołówek
Bez ogródek masz tu rap na stówę
To co nas wspiera i tyle lat jednoczy
Dotyczy prawdy, mówi prosto w oczy
Z linii frontu na żywo ten reportaż
Wiesz o co biega czy tu tylko sprzątasz
Tak jak Ty jestem tylko częścią w tej układance
Co nie znaczy że na wszystko patrzeć mam przez palce
Od zawsze przeciwko tanim chwytom i banałom
Pozostaję sobą, co by się nie działo
Odporną skałą na zawistne szepty
Wciąż żyje po swojemu bez niczyjej recepty

[Wilku]
Jestem WDZ, siemano wszystkim
Gdy wchodzę na scenę, to piszczą wszystkie dziwki
Gdy mówię zróbcie hałas, to wszyscy kurwa krzyczą
Cała sala zapierdala tylko prawdziwy hip-hop
Warszawski styl MorW.A, Hemp Gru
Prawdziwy hip-hop jest właśnie tu
Prawdziwy hip-hop co będzie trwał wiecznie
Uliczne rytmy, najlepszy towar w mieście
Ciesz się życiem, ja tak robię co dnia
Z czystym sumieniem w lustro spoglądam
Ze spokojem patrze w przyszłość
Wszystko w moich rękach
Nie raz jest pod górkę, ale nie wymiękam
Wiem jaki jestem wciąż szlifuję ten diament
Poukładane myśli przelewam na papier
Te same myśli tworzą problem więc je szybko zmieniam
Podpisano kowal swego losu, do usłyszenia!

Might gone off too far by now
Beaten up in a mental sense

You left me on so needless
The curtains cast, it's seamless
Will you be stopped or pass right through it

And you long to, keep it off you
Dancing often, and towards you
Till you've gone to, bleeding soften
Ones that got you, and so often

I see you off to end this
Were changing Gods' directions
Or kill before be helpless
Love carries on to pass right through it

And you long to, keep it off you
Dancing often, and towards you
Till you've gone to, bleeding soften

Don't let your boss catch you, don't stop

Who cares, it's gone, you know

But still, repair, what's lost
Not only happy ones

I got a story about D.C. to tell
And I don't think you're going to like it very well
It's about boys and girls, and the rich and the poor
But what if no one can afford to live here anymore?
Well I guess you can, 'cause you got a trust fund
You're so comfortable, but you're the only one
So I'm gonna turn it up and shake you down
'Cause your past is too clean, gonna throw it all around
You were brought up well, but your daddy never taught you
To keep your mouth shut
Well omigod!
We don't do that here!
Well now we do
You'll see what we're gonna do about you
You're taking one thing that one girl does
And making it represent all of us

The only thing you know is your rich boy world
You're talking politics on your pedestal
And you half-baked idea of ""what it means to be a
Girl""
But you can't feel how we suffer or we bleed
You can't give us what we want, much less what we need
Well omigod!
Well I know what you said!
Yeah you can't run!
You say the girls are dum, but not this one!
You narrow your world to the safest girl
And up your nose with all the rest
Well we do exist and we do insist
That a life that's boring is the life without risk
You don't know what it's like to be harrassed all day
Then to be told that you're only in the way
We're living in fear, trying not to disappear
So yeah, we're kinda weird, not normal, no way!
Well omigod!
We don't say that here!
Wll that's not cool
You say the boys are too, but why not you?
So I got a story about D.C. to tell
But I don't think you're goinna like it very well
It's about ""Nice Guys"" and the girls who let them
Be innocent as rain and about as thoughtless

And we'll raise our glass to another mistake
So what if us girls try to tear ourselves apart?

Seu Bicho de Estimação,Erasmo Carlos,"

Você podia me poupar
Depois de tanta ingratidão
Me riscar da sua lista
E devolver meu coração
Ainda sinto a dor do golpe
Que sangrou os meus desejos
Confundiu meu paladar
E eu bebi sem degustar
O doce veneno dos seus beijos
Eu que só queria ser feliz
Me esqueci o que o poeta diz:
Que o homem que é escravo de um sorriso
Vai perder as rédeas do juízo
Só lhe peço, por favor desista
No horizonte me perca de vista
O seu brinquedo se quebrou
Quando o amor que eu tinha se acabou
Não sirvo para ser
A sombra do que você quer
Jogue a coleira fora
Não sou mais seu cão
Adeus, eu vou me embora
Perdão, meu bem, você perdeu
Por um cochilo da razão

Ciudad Jardín,Vito (FR),"

He perdido las maletas que jamás abrí
He vendido conclusiones que dejan lugar
Para resolvernos antes de partir
O salir corriendo antes de llegar

[Acid Lemon]
Y sé que miras pero cuesta
Más por el silencio que por la respuesta
Dejando atrás nuestra condescendencia;
Hoy puedo caminar sin encontrarme
Y ya he llorado antes... antes de armarme de paciencia

Fue la promesa de otro invierno sin ti
Por no saber si contabas conmigo
Hacer camino y desdecirme de decirte que te quise, que nunca lo hice
Pero entonces parecía fácil ser feliz

Vuelvo a perderme en la espiral que dibujan tus labios
Vuelvo a tu historia sin creerme el decorado y el guion
Sigue siendo improvisado, y el control de este vagón
Lo retiene tu septiembre, los fantasmas del pasado

Si pasado un tiempo vuelves y he cambiado
Estoy bailando en el tejado un tango con mis dudas
Vivo alejado de mi ciudad porque es la tuya
Lancé los dados para cuando huyas

O suene Matilde Urbach, y no sepas ni a quién le escribo
Y me descubras gritando en el desierto de tus dudas;
En cualquier otro infinito que no sea el nuestro
En cualquier otro delito que mis versos, otro supuesto

Por cada última primera vez dejando pasar trenes
Durmiendo con miedo a que el tiempo pase
Perdiendo los papeles, dejándome tú en jaque y yo sin equipaje
En este viaje de ida y vuelta en órbitas lunares

Que si cambio ahora de planes no es por ti
Pero me asusta descubrir que hay otro lado en esta luna
Y joder, ya sé que miras pero cuesta decidir
Más por el silencio que por tu locura

[Vito]
A estas alturas, no sé si recordarte o recorrerte;
Fue suerte, arrojaba monedas a mi fuente
Bajábamos en la misma parada cada viernes
Allí la conocí, me enamoré al día siguiente

¡El mundo es un desastre y qué suerte que me entiendes!
Tiendes a idealizarme estando ausente
Y me vas salvando así, casi parece un accidente
Latente y oportuno, algunos ven a Neptuno y no a su tridente

De momento, todas estas hojas son del viento
Me lo dijo un hombre que escapó al yugo del tiempo
Estaba muerto de por vida, ¡de ese puerto no hay salida!
Silbaba una canción que me sonaba a despedida

Del desierto a la arboleda me verás
Cabizbajo en las veredas, con una sombra detrás
Y no es la mía, quedan afluentes todavía
Flores que nacen de noche y luces que me hacen de guía

Cambiamos de vagones y de vía;
Tu canción es poesía, me devora la utopía en ella
Te debía la mitad de nuestros días
Me guiña un ojo el mar cuando destella...y ahora que brilla

Estoy acercándome a la orilla con media botella
Y osos polares siguiendo una estrella
Me he conocido en los hoteles sin reparo:
Ruinas circulares al amparo de la luz de un faro

¡Y tú tan rota para un descosido!
Es el amor con su desvarío, ahora te canta el mío
Tiré los dados a un acantilado
¿cómo me dejo dejarme de lado cuando no te has ido?

He vendido los relojes antes de partir
He llegado a conclusiones que dejan lugar
Para resolver tu jaque de reina y alfil
O salir corriendo y volver a jugar

He perdido las maletas antes de llegar
Llevo las llaves de las puertas que jamás abrí
Hay una luz que me dibuja debajo del mar
Arrancándole una flor a mi Ciudad Jardín

Dread the Villains,Ataraxie,"

Here comes that glorious race of degraded beings
Smiling at those who will cross their usurped path
Premeditating everything required to establish fake links
But driveling in the back whenever they will be able to
All these scheming evildoers aspire to be surrounded
High are their hopes they won't refrain from trespassing
No real effort at all to make, they just shamefully wait for
The best moment to appropriate all thoughts shining
Mistrust the villains
Spokesmen of empty words
Dread the villains
Manufacturers of black phlegm
Will they ever get tired of overfeeding themselves?
Engorging more and more without absorbing once
Never satisfied, they're even able to eat your brain
So make sure to wrap ignominies with distorted gold
Keep on hand-feeding them but always string them along
Fill their hunger with scum until they can't forevermore
Envenom their thoughts until they are on the road to ruin
Then embalm them and use their remains as scarecrows
Teach your children how to identify double dealers
Do your best to fit them out with only strong weapons
Show them how to vomit astutely in their hollow brains
Sullying is the only weapon of those who envy

Don't bring me down, I want you more than a friend

I really do love you woman and I can tell you it's tough
I wanna give you just everything only the best is good enough

So if you really do want him, just take him and leave
And though I've put you to love him, I still which you loved me

Don't bring me down, I couldn't stand to fail again
Don't bring me down, can't you see I'm just a man?

Kayaknya aku lebih baik sendiri sekarang
Dan aku juga enggak mau sakit lagi

Apa yang terjadi dengan hatiku?
Ku masih di sini menunggu pagi
Seakan letih tak menggangguku

What Makes You Stay,Michael Ball,"

Look at me
I'm in a place
I never thought I'd be

Don't have the strength
To fight anymore
Or a reason not to leave

So tell me why I still keep holding on
To something I just cannot see

What makes you stay
When your world falls apart
What makes you try one more time
When it's not in your heart
At the end of your rope
When you can't find any hope
You still look at her and say
I just can't walk away
Tell me what makes you stay

I'm not afraid
Of living alone
I was alone before he came

I've been in love
Many times before
But this time's not the same

I've always been the first to say goodbye
Now it's the last thing I can do

What makes you stay
When your world falls apart
What makes you try one more time
When it's not in your heart
At the end of your rope
When you can't find any hope
You still look at her and say
I just can't walk away
Tell me what makes you stay

When it goes this deep
And feels this strong
I can't convince myself
That this love is wrong

What makes you stay
When your world falls apart
What makes you try one more time
When it's not in your heart
At the end of your rope
When you can't find any hope
You still look at her and say
I just can't walk away
Tell me what makes you stay

One, Two
Es un honor estar en esta latitud
¡Va!

[Verso 1]
¡Da igual si son 17 o es una multitud!
Vinimos por amor, traemos gratitud
Preciosa exactitud o tarde pero aquí
Para ver la tropa hacerlo así
La culpa es de los Hocus Pocus y 20syl
De Guru y los Jazz Matazz, banda y MC
¡Sí!
Todos se pone lento, algo grita detente
Tengo un motín organizado en la mitad del vientre
Nos tiembla todo pero sonrientes
Si cada que lo bailes, asientes
Amores y respetos a la fila del frente, el hommie de siempre
O a quien de lejos ve sin nitidez
Para quien ahí afuera lo siente
Y vino de fiesta otra vez

[Verso 2]
Amigos, tranquilos
Que todavía quedan skillez y estilos
Subtítulos y vaciles, vinilos
Cervezas fáciles, noches de júbilo en vilo (¡Vilo!)
La noche asalta, la gente salta
Y acá saltar es elevarse en una brevedad
La brevedad es una bóveda alta
Y lo alta depende su propia capacidad
Saltar por ansiedad o necesidad
O ausencia prolongada o soledad
Saltar para burlarse de la gravedad
Por curiosidad o levedad
Ya que no pudimos con la edad
Frases para la testa, la banda va de fiesta
Alegres aunque consientes que el mundo apesta
La noche sonriente y carnavalesca
Con planes de que se mantenga así hasta que amanezca

El ruido y sus ansias, lo pasos del RE
Sin pasos de baile y con saltos de fe
Las rimas, el aire. ¡La apuesta de Pe!
¡Vinimos con todo a ponerlos de pie!
La fila, la vez. La lista de cortes
Porque de nombres casi no sé
Arriba las manos que
Llegó el momento de saber desde acá cómo se ve
¡Aaaight!
Welcome a la nave. Ya ve
¡Que el tiempo se encargue de tardar en que acabe!
Tenía un saludo que dar pero que creo que lo olvidé
Intentando que todo encajara en la clave
¡Hay algo al parecer y hay que caer
Usted deje de inventar, si ya sabe qué hacer!
¡Ebrios de alegría por la vida y el placer
De tener esta fiesta y volverlos a ver!

[Intro: Bizzy Bone]
We gon' call this song ""Trickery and Treachery""
And man that's how these motherfuckers do
Man we gon' gear up these muh'fuckin soldiers man
Man up, fuck it do what you do

[Bizzy Bone]
Tell 'em that it's the trickery, treachery; damn they treacherous
This is gettin biblical baby nobody F'in us
Seen a lot of faces, been through so many phases
Give me Cristal baby man up, man up, yeah
Proud of the mental methodical mind hunter
Another game slumber game sleep if you wanna
Man up from unknown places when it's simple to be in love
Chromosomes broke down wonder is stuck
But when enough is enough, and it's tough
Throughout the roughest where the red wolves huff and they puff
Hey little Bizzy keep they head strong, cry now, can't even cuff
You understand it ain't no question, come up
What is the purpose of the physical lust? So the barricade can bust
Braids shaved ain't no bitches in us, we don't believe in no luck
But that's the word game, can't even cuff
Ya understand it ain't no question come up, ya understand

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
That's trickery, treachery; damn they treacherous
This is gettin biblical baby nobody F'in us
Seen a lot of faces and been through so many phases
Give me Cristal baby man up, ya better tell 'em
That's trickery, treachery; damn they treacherous
This is gettin biblical baby nobody F'in us
Seen a lot of faces and been through so many phases
Give me Cristal baby man up

[Bizzy Bone]
Back up in the saddle with my homies down in the cattle
Black boots, my fatigues and a satchel
Keep my eye up on the motherfuckin twos and the sixes
Get the fuck in the car, and put ya mind on the one-time bitches
You better know who the fuck we are, soldiers now
Fuck they try to figure me out, it's my style
But I was born with the jewel of a child
And it better be women around, I don't give a fuck if she wild
Ya fuckin with me? I tell her quickly bitch sit down, get down
You know I'm known to clown around and get around
That's the word praise God spirit
Shake your motherfuckin stick when the evil get on ya nerves, ya heard?

[Chorus 2X: Bizzy Bone]
That's trickery, treachery; damn they treacherous
This is gettin biblical baby nobody F'in us
Seen a lot of faces and been through so many phases
Give me Cristal baby man up

[Bizzy Bone]
Wanna crawl up out ya spiritual grave, if you a slave
To the wicked it's the critical mystical get out the way
Bitch, I'm gettin paid, whatever they say, shake the dust
Movin in +Heaven'z Movie+, in God we trust
Back to +The Gift+, let's get 'em lifted right now
Don't get caught up in the liquid, do da thang my mayne
What if I told you this was spiritual, not in yo' brain
Spread love baby break that chain
Pay attention to the laws, wash yo' drawers by hand if you have to
Praise God always all day before and after
Then take it to the tabernacle, cleanse that body
Learn the happiness and freedom that you felt from ya mommy
Heavenly Father they are gigglin, think this is a game
Let our words not be in vain; and remember

That was trickery, treachery; damn they was treacherous
This is gettin biblical baby nobody F'in us

Give me Cristal baby man up, ya understand

You take position
Maneuver through the traffic
Where your lifeline stops
Your house is full of plastic
If your first crime makes the world feel scientific
Will the rest of us enjoy decreased demographic cares
This is the new collapse the place
The wiretap that makes statistics feel romantic and electric
Scatter in force, panic, gray

Doctor,Flawless Real Talk,"

[Verse 1]
Uh, show up for my 3 o'clock shift
And notice everybody on this,  moving kinda' quick
That's cause, we got a patient and they sayin' he really sick
Don't nobody wanna' treat him cause they don't know what it is
I take him
I know that I can save him
I need to know his history to make an observation
What's his name? ""Hip-Hop""
Gotta' find out what he's taking
""Well his dad is in the other room and I know that he's been waitin' to talk to you""
He said ""I don't know! He just started to change
He comes home every night high off Lil' Wayne and took a trip with his cousin down south on a plane
Came back with tight pants never acting the same
He sips lean, takes Molly, that's not how I raised him
Doc, he's dying slow I need somebody to save him. Plus I heard you work is amazing, and I know that if he died that I could never replace him.""
So I told him I'd try

[Verse 2]
I started off looking at him for a few days
His neck looked like it was strangled by 2 Chainz
Nah, it couldn't be, no way I couldn't see, the blood type was A, on the chart I saw a Lil' B
Damn. I need to react quick, injected two CCs of that Kendrick
A double dose of J Cole and maybe that should fix, any Future bacteria that makes him sick
His heads swollen
Let's check his brain
We gotta ease the pressure and his vitals gotta' change
I thought it was a Gucci I ain't worried about a Mane until I saw he was infected with a Trinidad James
It's getting worse
Now, for days I keep trying to cure
A little Hov a little Nas cause they've done it before
I even tried a little Em I wish I had a Shakur, but that was '96 and they ain't making that anymore
I can't win.""

[Verse 3]
Look pops, it's not even a question
You know your son's infections will continue to be spreading
But I know about a medicine I shouldn't be suggesting
Cause it's off the Black Market and I know where we can get 'em
""What's it called?""
Flawless
""How'd you know if it'd work?""
Cause it's Flawless
It's unknown, really even to my bosses
But if you want to talk about it then step into my office
It's got about 10% Em and Big Ls delivery
20% Hov and 3 thousand lyrically
10% KRS battle skills for enemies
With just a little dose of Rakim for memories
The Storytelling enzymes of a Slick Rick
Should have him feeling like his old self in an instant
It's even got a little bit of Pac in that big flip
Along with Illmatic that'll leave it defenseless
Most of all, it's all combined in a fresh mix
With its own venom that's really the best fit
I tell you those infections in his ear are breakfast
But if he don't get it right now it's a death wish
""Where's it at?
It's all over the States, but we got to go where the first dose of it was made
Rhode Island
It's a tiny little place but it's where we're going to find it if we want to get him saved
Let's go

Pioggia,GionnyScandal,"

[Verse 1]
Ci sono giorni dove muori, oggi uno di questi
Quando dici: ""Va bene così"", ma con gli occhi spenti
Fuori è grigio, e dentro anche
Ed ogni cosa a cui penso non è un granché
La pioggia inganna, è una bugiarda, e prende in giro molti
Perché sembra solo acqua, e invece son ricordi
Avevo quattro genitori, ma me li hanno tolti
Avevo amici che contavano, e ora conto i soldi
Scrivo sempre canzoni tristi, perchè è ciò che sento
E perchè se non soffrissi, non lascerei il segno
Perchè se restiamo zitti, infondo stiamo peggio
La mia vita ha solo filtri in Bianco e Nero

[Chorus]
Oggi non mi cercare più
Esco a fare due passi
Fuori c'è il temporale, e tu
Non li vedi quei lampi?
Scusa ma voglio restare quassù
Da solo, a guardare
La pioggia che cade giù
E rimane giù, con me

[Verse 2]
Mi mancano le parole
Mi mancano le persone
Mi manca il mio vero nome
Mi mancano le emozioni
Mi bastano due parole: ""S'incantano"", ""Sembra Magico""
Frate, a me sembran macabre e sadiche le persone
E meno male che al mio gatto manca la parola
Probabilmente mi direbbe che sono una noia
In casa mia rimane il gelo, fra da quanto è vuota
E sti tatuaggi non mi coprono la pelle d'oca
Quando mi chiedon' di fidarmi, annuisco
Tutt'ora penso che fidarsi è autolesionismo
Non li capisco, li compatisco
Gli sbagli che hai fatto con me, non puoi correggerli con l'asterisco
Non credo alla reincarnazione, ma ci spero perché
Vorrei essere un delfino, per ridere sempre
Quale foto artistica?
Il rumore della pioggia è una canzone bellissima

[Chorus]
Oggi non mi cercare più
Esco a fare due passi
Fuori c'è il temporale, e tu
Non li vedi quei lampi?
Scusa ma voglio restare quassù
Da solo, a guardare
La pioggia che cade giù
E rimane giù, con me

[Bridge]
Oggi non mi cercare più
Esco a fare due passi
Fuori c'è il temporale, e tu
Anche oggi mi manchi
Scusa ma voglio restare quassù
Da solo, a guardare
La pioggia che cade giù
E rimane giù, con me

[Chorus]
Oggi non mi cercare più
Esco a fare due passi
Fuori c'è il temporale, e tu
Non li vedi quei lampi?
Scusa ma voglio restare quassù
Da solo, a guardare

Liar's Dream,Alli Rogers,"

All I want to say is that I'm sorry
And I don't even know why I'm angry anymore
The road just keeps on getting longer
And I'm getting older and I don't know how
But I can't run away
To places where the wind blows

I've handed over everything I own
To a liar's dream
I've given it my very heart and soul
But they can't save me now

I wish it weren't so hard to be forgiving
I'm hurting from the pain
That doesn't live here anymore
And if I really had to leave it all behind
I wouldn't know how
But I can't run away
To places where the wind blows
I believe there's a way
When things seem out of control

I've handed over everything I own
To a liar's dream
I've given it my very heart and soul
But they can't save me now

The cycle is tired of repeating
And I've got to move on
'Cause I can't keep running away
To places where the wind blows
I've got to believe there's a way
When things seem out of control
Letting go is not romantic

I've handed over everything I own
To a liar's dream
I've given it my very heart and soul
But they can't save
No they can't save, my heart can't save me now

Mírame más profundo yo sé que quieres entrar en mi mundo
Quédate junto a mi no vamos a dormir dime si quieres seguir
La cuidad nos espera sé que es oscura pero vamos fuera
Fia fi fíate de mi no te vas a arrepentir

Disfruto viéndolo tu cuerpo todo para mi
Siento enorme la pasión mi pecho contra ti
Un día me difícil de exigir
Muévelo enrédate dile que esto no es sufrir

Demuestra lo que sabes háblame así
Tan tierno y tan salvaje todo para mi
Altera mis sentidos vamos ven aquí
Condúceme al peligro poco a poco

Paso a paso hacia el olvido en qué momento se nos fue
Sáciame de ti sáciate de mi de un lado a otro
Cuerpo a cuerpo desde el suelo golpe a golpe hasta tocar el cielo
Abunda la pasión me gusta tu dolor esto es lo que quiero yo
No me cuentes tu secreto no lo quiero oír
No reveles tu misterio, déjalo ahí
Déjame, domíname lo mismo haré por ti
Trátame como debe ser hoy por ti, mañana por mi

Demuestra lo que sabes háblame así
Tan tierno y tan salvaje todo para mi
Altera mis sentidos vamos ven aquí
Condúceme al peligro poco a poco
Demuestra lo que sabes háblame así

Altera mis sentidos vamos ven aquí

Solo pienso en abusar de ti
Tu cuerpo suda soy toda tuya me dejas muda solo mis palabras junto a ti

Ni mis miedos y lo que fue, fue

[Verse 1]
Ain't but one way out, baby, Lord I just can't go out the door
Ain't but one way out, baby and Lord, I just can't go out the door
'Cause there's a man down there - might be your man, I don't know

[Verse 2]
Lord, you got me trapped, woman, up on the second floor
If I get by this time I won't be trapped no more
So raise your window, baby and I can ease out soft and slow
And Lord, your neighbors, no they won't be
Talking that stuff that they don't know

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Lord, I'm foolish to be here on the first place
I know some man gonna walk in and take my place, and
Ain't no way in the world I'm going out that front door
'Cause there's a man down there - might be your man, I don't know

[Outro]
'Cause there's a man down there - might be your man, I don't know
'Cause there's a man down there
Lord, it just might happen to be your man
Oh, it just-a might be your man

Oh baby, I just don't know

Beyond the Unknown,Edge Of Sanity,"

Take a trip with me, to endless insanity
Where no souls could live. Where no
Soule could rest the echoes of tormenti-
On, rips so psychic wounds into your
Mind. The longer we go, feeling the anaestesia of
Your soul, rise above the seas, the seas of
Torment

(Chorus:)
A creation of abnormal
Souls an evil place that grows the dark-
Ness of the abyss knows a creation of thee
Beyond the unknown life? Now take a trip
With me to a world of insanity where no
Souls could live. Where no souls could
Rest the echoes of tormention. Rips so
Psychic wounds into your mind. The lon-
Ger we go

[Tua – Part I:]
Und ich fall, endlose Lichtschlieren zieren
Überbeleuchtete Straßen, wie gemacht um sich zu verlieren
Da oben steht ""Du bist niemand"" in Leuchtreklame
Mit immer neuen Namen
In immer neuen Farben
Schnappschüsse so
Zusammenhangslos
U-Bahn ohne Endstation
Geschwindigkeit sehr hoch
Ich bin verloren, doch fühle mich eher wohl
Getragen von der leichten Gewissheit ich bin wertlos
Leute tanzen in Zeitlupe und unehrlich
Ich fühl mich, als ob mein Kopf blutleer ist
Es ist unmerklich
Sterb ich ein paar kleine Tode zwischendurch
Ich dachte sie sieht zu mir, aber sie sieht durch mich hindurch

Nachtschattengewächs

[Tua – Part II:]
Ich bin frei, keine Verantwortung für mich selbst
Kreis zu hoch über allem anderen auf der Welt
Es ist warmes Dunkel, vertraute Leere
Souveränität, als wären das hier meine letzten Stunden auf der Erde
Ich glaub ich sterbe
Sensation, ein Kopfschuss aus Glückshormonen
Er färbt die Wände rot
Merk das Ende droht
Ich fühle mich widersprüchlich
Der kleine Frieden hier in diesem Glück ist viel zu brüchig
Die Nacht erdrückt mich
Zerteilt und begräbt mich
Ich möchte jetzt kindisch sein, wie ""keiner versteht mich""
In dunklen Fensterscheiben, seh ich meine Spiegelbild
Widerwillen
Ich guck weg, es guckt immernoch

[Hook 6x:]

[Tua – Part III:]
Ich war grad in der Gegend, dachte ich schau vorbei
Kau ein paar Fingernägel und prügel mich mit der Zeit
Durch die Jalousie kriecht langsam Helligkeit
Und ich krieche als riesige Schnecke auf meinem Selbstmitleid
Ich könnte schwören, dass dieses Zimmer enger wächst
Ich hör mich die Schatten schimpfen ""Hände weg, ihr Menschenfresser""
Ich werd belagert von grellwacher Müdigkeit
Bis nur noch ein schmaler Pfad übrig bleibt und ich schlaf

[Vers 1]
Jeg ruller op og tar' det roligt
Pudser det fine glas, hælder druen i
Jeg' definitionen på go' stil
Har en sofa til to men der' tre ho's i
Skaber go energi
Har det bedre end nogensinde, det tog mig en krig
Jeg har været dernede hvor man ikke vil være
Hvor selv drengene måtte sige ""bar' lad nixen vær'""
Men jeg er stærkere
Sagde på tung mand: ""Der' intet du kan lære mig""
Savner ikke nogen som helst fordi de er der
Alt fra familie, til folk til koncerter
Har lige spillet Bremen, hvorfor ikke blære mig?
Ting går godt, sætter glæde over smerter
Teenage piger jeg ku' æde deres hjerter
Ta' dem med videre som en bærbar
Men jeg behandler dem ordenligt
Sæt dig ned babe, du danser dårligt
Går kun ned på dig hvis der' mad uden hår i
Bare drik ud, er du glad nu, så går vi
Sjovt hvad man må som rapper
De smiler bare dumt, siger at Nixen han vil ha' mig
Ingen selvrespekt og det tænder mig ikk'
Snakker lort hele tiden, men nu venter du lidt
Jeg laver punchline rap
Så du bli'r bare derhjemme på din online chat
Folk høre mig ligesom what the fuck
Wafande var det rubaaa bong bong bong
Før youtube var jeg kendt i Herlev
Jeg tar pis på meget, det bare min måde at være på
Snak pænt til mig, nu jeg pludslig er noget
Mr. jeg vil ha dig med, men jeg er gået
Vil du kneppe mig nu? jeg har hørt hvem du sammen med, jeg er ikke jaloux, men du kan kys mig på kinden, bare lad følensen forsvinde, jeg kan se noget noget på din finger der er begyndt at skinde
Diamander for evigt, jeg behandler dig hel vildt. Sig go' dag til det gode shit, flydende dope i sædvandlig dosis

Og jeg står lige her og det ikke på grund af jer, det det er på grund af de folk jeg har kær

For der mere succes når du nævner mit crew, for der mere succes når du nævner mit crew
Jeg tror jeg flyver væk i nat ser det smukke i alt, giv mig en grund til at falde så højt op

Ven når jeg ik er, lad vær og skriv at jeg kommer når jeg ik deltager
Vi ik i samme liga, opad bedre end da jeg arbejde med giga
Nixen min egen bedste feature. - herlevítter hælder i sig
Og jeg ved det er min tid, musik med stolthed og vigtig viden
Folk følger bare en trend der er ikke sket en skid, der kun autotune og ingen selvtillid
Har jeg sagt for meget? - er du stødt allerede, hvor længe har den sang varet?
Jeg er kun lige startet ligesom er du dum, er det noget der vare ved, det klar besked
Jeg er på mit eget shit, der gør jeg ikke har det godt det gør jeg det fedt
Det gør jeg ikke laver lort, lad de andre om det, ka' ka' de klap i takt, og hvor mange skal der til?
Jeg er langt over stregen du sniffer,  drengene er på, men jeg er min egen kaliber
Skriver mine egne kapitler, lave mine egne beats så..

Now this is one night that I'll never forget
You see, it was just like in the movies
I mean, it actually happened just like this
Yeah yeah...

The stars were shining
Brighter than most of the time
Then love came out of nowhere, yeah

(The night that I fell in love)
It surely was the best thing I ever did that night
(The night when I fell in love)
The stars' lights were in your eyes
(The night that I fell in love) with you

Been to most parts of the world
And seen some things that have blown my mind
Yes I have but...

Nothing will ever be like

The stars' lights were in your eyes
(The night that I fell in love) with you

Ooh yeah, I thought I could be happy
Without any love in my world
But now I know that, that is so untrue

We’ll have no telephones here
Just a gentle mouth to a smitten ear
No technology here

We’ll use no binary code
No pixilated template to contain us both

We’ll stay right here and want for nothing more

We will set out ourselves and switch everything off

No machinery here
No chain smoking factories with their monotone sneer
There’s no technology here
No damning indictments or digital sin
So can’t we both disappear?
Run away and play dead like i did last year
We’ll need nobody else at all
Sheltered and happy in our candlelit hole

See the lady there
With flowing golden hair
She is the one who knows
She is the one who cares
Look up to the sky and beyond the sun
For it is there from where
She chose to come, come come

See the clothes she wears
Of silk and satin fayre
All as pure as
The intention that she bears
To save our hearts and minds
From such as our kind
Thus to lead us to
Fields of pastures new

To end the suffering
And pain and misery
To alter all our thoughts
And the course of history
And then the sun may shine
As one to us
Then disguised as two
We all turn to dust

Dust, dust, dust

And if we should heed
And listen closely to
This voice from far away
From far beyond the sun

From a land that once was
A reflection of ours now
But is also no more
But an image of our future times

So we must take this as a warning
We must listen and understand
Because the world won't last forever
The glass is running out of sand

So we must try
We must pull together
As one, see reason
The lady speaks (she speaks)
With a truthful tongue
We must listen and act upon
This message of salvation
Our salvation

Sono sfinita e valuto che
Sarebbe più semplice lasciar perdere
Mi domando se posso scegliere..
Distrattamente finisco il mio tè
Considerando che son già le tre di notte
Cena macrobiotica, le tue labbra
Miele, fragole, coltrane… la pioggia
Sto imparando lentamente l' arte della
Seduzione
Vino rosso a luci spente le tue mani mi
Accarezzano
Non riesco a controllarmi ed è sempre
Più evidente
Come puoi disorientarmi....
Trepida attesa sento sciogliermi
Non mi sorridi vuoi confondermi
Nutro il desiderio di toccarti
Senza più coerenza lasciarmi...

Wake up boys, we're in the dump again
Can't get a taxi, it's bucketing rain
Heading downtown with nothing in my brain
Trying to catch my breath

Tired legume in a smoke-filled room
The high school guys are making noise outside
Walking the hall with my shoes untied
Dying to catch my death

And now it's Pekoe tea
With a reflection of me
My only company
As far as I can see
We're doing this the hardest way
Back at the Hotel Majestic
Same time every day
Hey hey

Watch what you wish for, maybe wish too much?
You'll wake up in Westmoreland doubling Dutch
Aware of the uproar but numb to the touch
Sifting through bad poetry

A sweet disorder never served me as well
As a tape recorder and a worn-out Dell
Time to reorder, man I feel like hell
I wonder what's on TV

And now it's Pekoe tea
With a reflection of me
My only company
As far as I can see
We're doing this the hardest way
Stuck in the Hotel Majestic
Six nights, seven days

I wake up around two o'clock
Scrape off my eyelids and' search for my socks
Holy shit, I'm late
Now it's knock knock knock
Let's go

We're doing this the hardest way
Doing this the hardest way

Serpent of infinity, the infinite snake
Scales upon scales and waves in its wake
Monolithic obelisk entwined in figure eight
Cold-blooded treachery stands guard at the gate

I will find the open wound
As above, so below
Contort and harden, painful and ever slow
As above, so below
The torturous snake constricts the captured dove
As above, so below
Little heed to warnings, no softening of the blow
As above, so below

We both know this is the only way up
And yet you work the needle without an eye
""I would rather eat myself than allow you to pass
I, the swallower of the future, the devourer of the past
I am the harrowing fear you swore would never last
Forever are you entombed in the shadow you cast""

Walk forever
And now you walk on forever
You work the needle without an eye
But I will follow the open wound

Right here, face to face in your sheets
We're tucked underneath all these city street lights
Where everything starts with your kiss
Didn't I do it all for the nights like this

So I built up a home in your chest
You gave me the space, so I put my bags down
Now empty, with boxes unpacked
I didn't know it was a month-to-month rent

[Bridge]
Didn't I keep hoping that your heart would stay open
For more than the night
Didn't I, didn't I
And when you said you're sorry, it was a likely story
But I ran to your side like a ghost in the night

[Chorus]
When the light is so bright
You get a little bit, little bit blinded
When you're lifted so high
Your falling feels like flying
When you're lost in those eyes
Feels like you might be gone forever
So, one last kiss then let it end on a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this

With your hands held up over my eyes
All the dark looks like some kind of starry sky
But we're on the edge of a burning high-rise
And you know that I, I did it all just to lose your grip

But didn't I keep hoping that the truth meant nothing
I heard what you said, but I know what you did
Didn't I keep trying, even when your lies were lying
Like a thorn in my side, every time, didn't I?

When the light is so bright
You get a little bit, little bit blinded
When you're lifted so high
Your falling feels like flying
When you're lost in those eyes
Feels like you might be gone forever
So, one last kiss then let it end on a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this

Didn't I keep hoping that the truth meant nothing
I heard what you said but I know what you did

And I would say his limit is the sky

O Eduardo está em Paes desde que era Garotinho
O Fernando teve Collor pra salvar os nossos filhos
Zé Dirceu, Sarney, Nader em Serra isso
Getúlio nas horas Vargas não pensava em suicídio

[Verso 1: Nissin]
Difícil achar um que Prestes na nação brasileira
Cabral se banha embaixo, Dilma Cachoeira
ACMergência, ACMinência
Indica um estado de Jaderpendência
Defesa civil, Sérgio na Yamaha
Mestre em dar voltas nos prédios da Barra
Porque no Brasil, corrupção é Genoíno
No Palócio do Planalto Nagi Narra Pinheirinhos
Depois de Dantas mentiras, de tucanos e petistas
Isso calha pra Calheiros, governo e oposicionistas
Todos tão do mesmo lado, todos são da mesma firma
Eles negam até a morte e você aperta ""confirma""

[Refrão]
Ninguém vai ser meu juiz, pois não há discernimento
Tá na hora de alguém justo ter poder no julgamento
No país da saia da justa e do dinheiro na cueca
Quem faz cara de santinho na real é quem mais peca
No país da saia da justa e do dinheiro na cueca
Corrupção é uma fonte e parece que não seca
No país da saia da justa e do dinheiro na cueca
Vejo no Brasil inteiro, mas Brasília é a Meca

[Verso 2: Nissin]
Na tribo do Pajéfferson o que vale é Valério
Foi pro céu só Daniel, porque incomodou o império
Nem todo Cavalcanti é humorista Severino
O povo é aéreo e o Império é Marinho
Beira mar é uma gota, ignoramos o oceano
Isso vem do americano e do Russomano
O país não quer um Bastos e sim um basta
O que não falta é valete pra completar os canastras

Porque em São Paulo ele e Pitta bordam
Quem teme não deve, mas quem deve Temer
Demóstenes porque existe a PM

Bispos não vão pro xadrez
Macedo 500 anos Crivella do português
PC também faria dinheiro no Bolsonaro
Não adianta pedir Arruda quando vir o mau olhado
Da Figueira de Figueredo não Delúbio os galhos
Kubitschek cheque mate seus adversários

Oh! Take me back to dear old Blighty
Put me on the train for London Town
Take me anywhere
Drop me anywhere
Liverpool, Leeds or Birmingham
But I don't care
I should like to see

[Intro 2]
I don't bless them

[Verse 1]
Farewell to this land's cheerless marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between archers
Her very Lowness with her head in a sling
I'm truly sorry but it sounds like a wonderful thing
I say Charles don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your mother's bridal veil?

[Verse 2]
And so I checked all the registered historical facts
And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the 18th pale descendent
Of some old queen or other
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?
Some nine year old tough who peddles drugs
I swear to God, I swear I never even knew what drugs were

[Verse 3]
So I broke into the Palace
With a sponge and a rusty spanner
She said: ""Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing""
I said: ""That's nothing - you should hear me play piano""
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you are tied to your mother's apron
No-one talks about castration

[Verse 4]
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
Like love and law and poverty
(These are the things that kill me)
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But the rain that flattens my hair
(These are the things that kill me)
All their lies about makeup and long hair, are still there

[Verse 5]
Past the pub that saps your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the pub that wrecks your body
And the church, all they want is your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb

Why don't they let us go

Así, así marrano, marrano
Bonita, ¿nos vamos?

Me prometiste discreción
Por tus pujidos nos pescaron
Te la mamaste concepción
Si bien sabes que soy casado
Todo por hacerte el jalón
De echarte un palito en el carro

Todo por no hacerte un desaire
Vengo a pasar estas vergüenzas
Yo nunca había estado en la calle
Así enseñando toa' la verga
Frente a un chingo de judiciales
Y los flachasos de la prensa

Ay, Conchicta, que chinga
Nos arrimaron por andar de cachondotes
Quien iba a pensar que el precio
De tu pepa iba a ser dormir en el bote
Ay, Conchicta, lo peor es que después
De esta cojida mocha
Ya todo mundo va a conocer en el extra
Mi verga y tu panocha

Bonita, tápese la panochita

Ay, Conchicta, que chinga nos arrimaron
Por andar de cachondotes
Quien iba a pensar que el precio
De tu pepa iba a ser dormir en el bote
Ay, Conchicta, lo peor es que después

Ya todo mundo va a conocer en el extra

Who's watching the cars from the corner of cul-de-sacs?
Who's charging the lawns like an order to grow long?
I am
Vain in my bare window
I am
Aiming my telescope
I am
I've been riding on my high horse
And I do wait all sullen and sodden above it all
About a mile
I will post up still on this pedestal that I built
And I build my anthills and the cities glow that are build with an enviable skill
Guess we're born out of gore
But I'm blessed with impermeable pores
What a show, my noble chromosomes in ordered rows
And I suffer fools like you
And I suffer fools all my life
And I will blow my hot air
Pulling ants from my hair in my armchair (in my armchair)

But now just as things change
As well my feelings do
In time things rearrange
I am so sick of chasing you

And playing those games as I wait for your call
And now I give up, so goodbye and so long

Sem talento, só dão cabeçada
Tão sempre 2 passos pra trás

Tá pensando o que?
Tá achando que eu sou o Bozo

Confesso eu não sou pioneiro
Mas não importa quem chegou primeiro
Eu fiz essa porra direito
Eles querem flash, eu só quero dinheiro

Não preciso surfar no seu hype bro
Se quer me achar, já sabe onde eu tô
Tô fazendo hit, ou tô fazendo show
Pouco me fodendo pro que cê achou

Cada movimento tem que ser pensado
Chego discreto e ligeiro igual um gato
Agora que cê percebeu e ficou preocupado
Tarde demais, o estrago já foi consumado

Nunca me preocupo com os horários
Faço o meu tempo e vocês que tão atrasados
Daqui 10 anos, vão falar que eu era visionário
Daqui 10 anos, vão continuar frustrados

Todo mundo é inimigo até que se o prove o contrário
Eu é que não caio no conto do vigário
De repente  até posso ta enganado
Mas não pago pra ver porque o preço é muito alto

Esse é meu último ano quebrado

Eu não quero ouvir que eu mudei

Elza no pescoço e ela dança
Gata, cê sabe que a gente só transa
Então por favor não me cansa

Eu sei, ela quer me conhecer

Tô bem melhor do que antes

Tears,The Crüxshadows,"

Reaching out in deadened night
Emptiness by candlelight
Memory a haunted sea
Souring in sudden rage
The Damage plagued upon my love
Driven by this selfish urge
To separate yourself from me
But not the way you planned

The gambit flow of shifting thought
Shall ride a kiss upon my cross
And with each moment of despair
Lay to heart a lovely tear
Within each bulb the salty sea
Swims an ocean silently
Swims the forest of my dreams
Swims the essence of my being (...I call me)

Come ringing back now
(can't explain)
The measures swept away in pain
Hatred will I escape your grasp
Buried feelings let me pass
I cannot kill this final flame
The fire that once consumed my heart
For hope must have some kind of fuel
And chance must keep this fire

(Spoken) reduced to ashes, We run colder on the outside. A Spartan hope that dwindles near the source of this contempt. What has my hopeful certainty for the future returned upon my desperation and difficult memory, besides wasted moments, whose questions are not resolved? Simple things went un-addressed until such time as they could only pass away. Losing you shall (forever mark my breast. Injury knows no justice.)

Swimming out with tears in my eyes
Looking for the shore
I hope that this is the last time...
I hope that this is the last time...

Lost,Donna Hughes,"

A man in the parking lot, down on his luck
Came and asked if I could spare a few bucks
I shoulda helped him, I shoulda cared
So before I fell asleep I said a little prayer
He must have no one to stand behind his dreams
No matter how crazy they seem
He must be scared, and alone
Begging for a dollar, searching for a home

Chorus: Without a family like mine
To turn to when you don't have a dime
Or a friend he could call
And I think he's lost, I think he's lost.....his way home

He may have talent and a dream he could chase
He may be a genius whose simply lost his way
I coulda helped him, I shoulda cared
I hope he finds a nice warm bed out there
He may have gone to Sunday School
In nice clothes and brand new shoes
Something happened along the way
For him to be alone, lost and afraid

Maybe I'm a Girl... So What?,Matvey Cherry,"

I’m all dressed up
Or just in some casual hoodie
I’m wearing makeup
Or hiding my face from the crowd
Does it at all matter
When I’m loving and kind
Or secretly weeping
Because of my broken heart?

Why should I fit in your borders
And surrender to your orders?
Prejudices are a drag
Maybe I’m a girl
So what?

Why are we all so afraid
Of just being ourselves?
Blue and pink, fights and tears –
They are for everybody
Does it at all matter
That I’m not a stereotype
We all can be living humans
With open hearts and minds

Why should I fit in your borders
And surrender to your orders?
Prejudices are a drag

Basureta (Tiempos Raros),Kase.O,"

[Letra de ""Basureta (Tiempos Raros)""]

[Estrofa I]
Aburrimiento visceral. Hipocondría. Angustia cósmica
El punto más lejano del sol en mi órbita
El puro hastío de vivir es mi amarga tónica
Miedos que suplo con apariencias
Odio a uno mismo y al sistema de creencias
Como un masoca en manos de una sádica
Es la relación de mi alma con mi conciencia
Soy reservado, me protejo de hablar
Pues las palabras comprometen, prometen
Un hombre sin palabra es lo mismo que una cabra
Un oso o una serpiente
Yo no creo en nada, evito desengaños
Me alejo de todo lo que pueda hacerme daño
Luego supe que la gloria no es para los prudentes
Una vez arriesgué y acabé desconfiando de la gente
Manteniendo siempre las distancias
Rancias relaciones sin sustancia
No alejarse del vampiro
No es más que un sinsentido consentido
Si tan sólo hubiera tenido la oportunidad, se habría ido
Pero se quedó a mi lado. No lo olvido
Yo deliraba deprimido todo el día
Y aun así ella me miraba con todo el amor que podía
Fantaseando con un bucle:
Sentir pena de sentir pena
Sin fuerzas ni ganas, con fuerte desgana
Planeando una existencia plana:
Blanco sobre blanco. Negro sobre negro. Y así sucesivamente
Ser uno con el vacío y tumbado
Caer, decaer y recaer profundamente
Redundar en lo obsoleto. Quedarse quieto
Renunciar a los servicios del esqueleto
Crear un ghetto en el sofá
Despedirse del sol y del viento. Morir despierto
Rebeldía contra la propia rebeldía
Hoy no abriré los ojos en todo el día
Vivir en un túnel, dormir en un túnel
Así hasta ser una piedra más del túnel
Constatar la propia dejadez
Decirse ""Adiós. ¡Muy buenas! ¿Nos conocimos alguna vez?""
Moverse solo para hacerse porros y cambiar de track
Sedarse. Morirse de sed
Bucear en la mentira. Nadar en la nada
Sucumbir a las lágrimas, ni ácidas ni saladas
Ni dulces ni amargas, sí neutras, siniestras
Me he convertido en una estatua
He desarrollado el llanto perfecto
Pero no dan premios por esto, ni afecto
Golpes que se llevan las puertas:
Señales invisibles si no estás alerta. Atento.
Desconectado. He necesitado meses
Para descubrir que estaba equivocado
Hay mariposas que parecen monstruos
Y hay rostros que se quedan grabados
Como alguien me engañó dejé de ser compasivo
Y cada día me volví más cruel
Pagaron justos por pecadores
Nerón me hablaba, oírle fue el peor de mis errores
Explotando en el momento más inoportuno
Lanzo el día a la basura en el minuto 1:
No le he dado un beso ni las gracias por el zumo
Le he vuelto a amargar el desayuno
Con mis deseos de morir al despertar
Con un tío así ¿Quién coño quiere estar?
Otro gesto de mierda. Otra mala respuesta
Otra mirada acusadora de mierda y la hice llorar
Es por eso que me quiero reventar
¡Cuando se vaya a trabajar me voy a rajar!
¡Ese no soy yo! ¡Ese no soy yo!
Oí mi voz: ""Sólo Dios te puede salvar""
Y fui a un cura a que me exorcizara
Me dijo: ""Tú eres noble, sólo es una etapa rara
Cuídate y cuida más de tu amada
Dios está contigo, hijo mío, no temas a nada.""
Al final, la solución estaba en mí
Aún no la encontré pero estoy ahí
Se me vino grande el mundo, no pude con la presión
Ojalá no hubiera escrito esta canción
Sueño con mi madre abrochándome el abrigo
Fotos de mi vida en las acequias
Nadie puede devolverme a mi amigo Carlos
Ni puede quitárme lo de aquellas tardes
El reloj no anda hacia atrás
Ni siquiera se nos permite la pausa
Tic-tac-tic-tac inaudible que atormenta
El tiempo es una broma macabra
Voy hacia la muerte aterrado
Habiendo malgastado la vida enfadado
Ahora me da pena irme
Sabiendo que el tiempo que gasté en odiarme no me sirve
Suenan las campanas anunciando ya mi hora
Córpore Insepulto: ¡parece que llora!
Lagrimas recientes en mi piel inerte
El grito de mis ojos por no poder volver a verte
Yo te amaré hasta en el más allá
Allí te esperaré con mi chilaba blanca
Si no me perdonas no descanso en paz
Yo siempre estuve enamorado de tu alma
Soy el encarga'o de tu felicidad
Pongo toda mi bondad en la balanza pero no alcanza
Nunca perdiste la fe en mí
Ni la esperanza de que solo fueran tiempos raros

And who I wanna be

It's like I forgot
What I want
But that's not me

I pull my head out of the sand
It's easy to live underground
I open my eyes now I've found
A way to turn
To turn it around

To turn it around

[Verse 2]
Do you ever look through the window
And see yourself on the outside looking in
And now you're stuck on a horse
On a carousel that won't stop going 'round

[Pre Chorus]
I see what I am
What I'm not
And who I wanna be

It's like I forgot
What I want
But that's not me

I pull my head out of the sand
It's easy to live underground
I open my eyes now I've found
A way to turn
To turn it around

To turn it around

[Bridge]
I dream about the places that I want to, want to see
And think about the life I really want to, want to lead

[Chorus]
I pull my head out of the sand
It's easy to live underground
I open my eyes now I've found
A way to turn
To turn it around

To turn it around
Around
To turn it around

Esta Vez,Ciudad Infierno,"

Recorriendo estas viejas calles
En el oscuro amanecer
Recordando tus besos y el olor de tu piel

Solo quiero volverte a ver
Solo quiero sentir tu piel
Solo quiero aceptar mi muerte
Esta vez

Tu mirada se desvanece
Como el olor de tu piel
Ahora el silencio me desnuda al amanecer

Cada instante me habla de ti
Cada paso me acerca al fin
Cada día es rifar mi suerte
Esta vez

Pasos que en el camino
Hoy me alejarán de aquí
Almas que en su destino
No vuelven a coincidir

Soledad que me habla de ti
Soledad que me acerca al fin
Soledad que abrazas mi muerte
Esta vez

Debo tener presente que un principio tiene un fin
Que nada es para siempre
Aunque hoy duela estar sin ti

Solo quiero volverte a ver
Solo quiero sentir tu piel
Solo quiero aceptar mi muerte
Esta vez

Swallowing pain with violet
Typical ""i'm okay"", she said
As she wiped the tears from her eyes
Just another night of no surprise

She doesn't wanna talk
Because oh ""she's so cool""
She had troubles to walk
Am I, to you, a brain-sick fool?

##pre-chorus
Then she talked about
How she wanna be saved
""from what?""
I asked
Then she forgot what she talked about
“thought you want to be saved? from what?”

##chorus
She’s spilling drinks because she's unsure
She thinks silent treatment is the cure
Well I couldn't seem to stop you
She couldn't seem to stop to

Talk about the boy who doesn't love her
Talk about the girls/  she doesn't admire
“from what?“
""your heart?""

##verse
I love how the phone sucked the soul out of her
Shame that her pretty face's glued on it forever
She said, ""i only smoke when I'm drunk""
As she's making faces for the snaps again

And then her tongue's losing flavor
Well mine's occupied as we talked in vapour
""oh darling could you do me a favor?""
Just stop your crying now
He's not your goddamn saviour

Billy Green,Stan Rogers,"

Attend you all good countrymen, my name is Billy Green
And I will tell of things I did when I was just nineteen
I helped defeat the Yank invader, there can be no doubt
Yet lately men forget the name of Billy Green, the Scout

'Twas on a Sunday morn' in June when first we heard the sound
Three thousand Yankees on the road to camp below Greentown
Two Generals, Artillery and Company of horse
With many rank and file afoot, they were a mighty force

Says I to brother Levi, ""Well, we still can have some fun!
We'll creep and whoop like Indians to try to make them run!""
Which then we did both loud and long, much to the Yanks' dismay
They fired their 'pop-gun' muskets once and then they ran away

Well, first they plundered Stoney Creek and then John Gage's farm
They cut his fences for their fires although the day was warm
They bound my brother Isaac up and took him from his home;
They pillaged all the countryside, no mercy there was shown

Then says I to myself, ""Now Billy, this will never do
Those scurvy Yanks are not the match for Loyalists like you""
My brother's horse I quickly caught and put him to a run
And reached the British camp upon the heights of Burlington

Says I to Colonel Harvey, ""Now, let there be no delay
If we're to reach the Yankee camp before the break of day
I'll take you through the woods by night where I know every tree
And ere the dawn you surely can surprise the enemy.""

With men and guns we then set forth the enemy to seek
Across the beach at Burlington and then to Red Hill Creek;
We came upon their sentries; we surprised them every one
One died upon my sword, and all the others off they run

And so it was we were in place one hour before dawn
We fired three times upon the camp and then we marched along
We fired again and charged as Colonel Harvey gave the word
And put the enemy to fight with bayonet and sword

With great confusion in the camp, two Generals were caught
The Colonel and his men made their artillery as naught
We killed over two hundred and we captured all the rest;
Nor did we lose but eighty men; of them we had the best

And so it was I played the man though I was but nineteen
I led our forces through the night that this land would be free
I foiled the Yank invaders and I helped put them to route
So, let no man forget the name of Billy Green, the Scout

Tag Eins nach Dir - Radio Version,Rapsoul,"

Schmez lass nach
Ich kann es kaum noch ertragen
Mit jedem augenblick wird es schlimmer irgendwie

Du bist so weit weg
Du bist so weit weg
Denk an dieses Glück vom anderen stern
Es ist am andern Tag so weit entfernt
Du bist so weit weg

Es ist der Tag eins nach dir
Du bist weg
Und ich merk wie ich innerlich krepier
Ich kann die leere in mir fühlen
Denn mein Herz schlägt nicht mehr
Hörst du das?
Mein Herz schlägt nciht mehr
Es ist der
Tag ein nach dir
Und ich will ständig mit dir reden
So als wärst du noch hier
So als wärst du in der nähe
Als könnt ich dich noch spüren
Als wär das foto hier am Leben
Doch es spricht nicht mit mir

Ein meer aus Sternen
Taucht auf in der Ferne
Un mit ihm diese angst dich zu verlieren

Du bist so weit weg
Du bist so weit weg
Denk an dieses Glück vom anderen stern
Es ist am andern Tag so weit entfernt
Du bist so weit weg

Es ist egal wie weit ich fahr
Oder wie lange ich lauf
Mit dir war es sonnenklar
Jetzt hört der Regen nicht auf
Hab keine Antwort darauf
Du warst einfach so weg
Ohne nur ein Wort zu sagen
Ohne Streit oder Stress
ALles was bleibt ist jetzt weg
Du hast alles gelöscht
Und Erinnerungen verfliegen
Wie die Blätter im Herbst
Steh vor den Scherben und dem Mist
Das ist alles was bleibt
Ich könnt schreien doch ich will schweigen
Es ist alles vorbei

Ich kann es kaum noch ertragen
Mit jedem augenblick wird es schlimmer irgendwie

Du bist so weit weg
Du bist so weit weg
Denk an dieses Glück vom anderen stern
Es ist am andern Tag so weit entfernt
Du bist so weit weg

Es ist der Tag eins nach dir
Ich hab so viel gewient wegen dir
Und jetzt rufst du nicht mal an
Wenn du's nie wieder tust was dann?
Ich kann für nichts garantieren

Es ist der Tag ein nach dir
Du hast ncoh so viele sachen bei mir
Und wann immer ich was seh
Tut genau die stelle weh
An der mein Herz für dich schlägt

Twice Inna Lifetime,Black Star,"

[Intro: Talib Kweli]
Yo, we been through this before right? (Word, word)
So we figured, if we gon' do it, we gotta freak it
You know what I'm sayin? (True, true, true)
Cause, everything gotta go up from here, right?
So Hi-Tek, turn it up a notch

[Verse 1: Jane Doe]
Hail Mary, matter fact, hail Jane
Niggas take my name in vain like I was cocaine
My affirmations kill emcees like assassination
Bringin' you pain until you wish you had a vaccination
Or vaccine, I shine like Vaseline
Gas plays like petroleum, walk over them like linoleum
My vocab expand like a rubber band
Walkin' naked through the motherland, give the finger to my brotherman
You niggas just don't understand my reasons
I transcend like season, and scar these rappers like Legion
It's treason, my suspension attract attention
I'm ventin', givin' these chickenheads detention
Did I mention my name? Yo, go by the Jane Doe
Drenched in Polo, chill downtown in Soho
You don't know, this is just half my potential
Check my credentials, come harder than sequential
It's essential, you listen, I drive, you a pedestrian
They bless me on the track cause I attack wit' the estrogen
Rhyme against the best of men, Jane burn it up
When you hear it in the whip, tell your man to turn it up!

[Verse 2: Wordsworth]
Yo, get it, yo
Yo, we fortified live, supportin' allies
The wack is tryna shorten our lives, it sorta waters my eyes
But here somethin' the cryin' talk about, the verse on that cassette
You and your cousin fought about, that led to God and Satan's fallin' out
Encourage the liquor for those who ain't here that you pourin' out
On three-way, your parents, preacher and spouse called my house
Revive or ruin, my theories of mics
Sony or Aiwa, black or white, I fit in all stereotypes
Search for a cast to plot, I make you a laughin' stock
So shook, I could walk a half a block and feel the aftershocks
Rain of acid drops, seek some help, now don't rewind
Get it the first time, shouldn't have to repeat myself
Eternally verbally, I have numbers succumb to time outs
In rhyme bouts, you'll dial 9, just to get a line out
Known fact or factors and non-rappers fractured
Results more cast appearances than a hundred actors
Emcees I'm testin' like diseases injected in gerbils
Wordsworth, Kweli, Hi-Tek, Reflection Eternal, what?

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
My style highlights like fonts when I burn heads like a conk
Cause niggas front, when their chances get slim like Pharoahe Monch
Thinkin' they shits is heavy when they light like illumination
Intellectual masturbation with premature ejaculation
I'm comin' cleaner than vaccinations, my fascination with character
Assassination, got these niggas burnin' like sensation
We keep it hot like matches, and on lock like latches
Wack emcees get they microphones snatched like Lee patches
So you go, to every wack muthafucka that you know (Scram...)
My lyrics they get up in your jeans like Parasucos
So there's no mystery about the father, niggas is hot and bothered
Like the bitches that they are, takin' pictures with stars
And got 'em open, but after they little hopes and dreams get broken
Me and Hi-Tek, we live long and prosper like Vulcans
Think I'm jokin'? We both got sons, we make cream and break dreams
See through the fake schemes, wipin' your slate clean
Like a squeegee, we be lightin' shit up like phosphorus
Turnin' flamboyant niggas anonymous, depressin' to optimist
You stoppin' us is preposterous like an androgynous misogynist
You pickin' the wrong time, steppin' to me when I'm in my prime like Optimus
Transformin', from rookie of the year to veteran
Hip-hop is big business like Con Edison or medicine
But fuck it, they gonna let us in, or else we rush the door
I got too many reasons, save your 'whys' and 'what fors'

[Chorus: Talib Kweli & Mos Def]
This is twice in a lifetime so I'm lettin' you know (let 'em know yo)
Black Star, Wordsorth, Punchline and Jane Doe (yo!)
Lyrical compete and we emcee
We got the fortified five, exhibit level degree

[Verse 4: Punchline]
Check it
I keep dough in my pocket while you follow the false prophet
Get deep like Islamics wrapped in a white garment
I touch topics that try to open up your optics
Vacate in the tropics, you dodgin' bullets in the projects
Cut the nonsense, I'm hotter than a lot of men
Start honorin', got more wifeys than Solomon
Fuck the squad you in, ayo, we be the bid-domb
Regardless what I spit on, you worse with the tracks I shit on
Once you get on, it's fair you can't trust (Yes!)
Words & Punch, make rappers march like the third month
I build with friends, lyrically spit gems
Call me Diamond, cause I'm your girl's best friend
Emcees are born losers, alcoholic abusers
I'll go on the radio and start a gay rumor
And then I'll talk about how the crowd tried to boo ya
Label shoot ya, stressed out with brain tumors
My gat claps, 50% of the wack
Take it back to real rap, Krylons wit' the fat cap
Get robbed for your ASCAP, leave you inside
Fortified live, reppin' NY 'til I die

[Verse 5: Mos Def]
Black body radiation situation that we workin' wit'
My verb exists enlisted by the bogeys campin' services
The purpose is, make you go and purchase this, no nervousness
We are, hot like black tar, Black Star with emergerence
Superlative, you fabricated like the word ""absurditive""
I'm rockin' this from here to where the Persians live
From Brooklyn where the merchants live next door to the murderers
And bourbon is a elder man's medicinal alternative
My memory is furnished with back streets to back seats to fat Jeeps
Legendary athletes who played by the trash heap
My crew wasn't that deep, but beef we didn't act sweet
Treadin' on these stompin' grounds, you better catch some black feet
Flashy, it was between DeKalb and Pulasky
Off the meter like an out of borough taxi
They run your pockets fastly, black and nasty, nappy and crafty
That's why they're either sittin' in Clinton or Coxsackie
Mayor Rudolph can screw off, you too soft to stop us
You and your coppers should see some foot doctors
Got your bird chest popped up, but keep your guns cocked up
Cause all them cats that you knocked up ain't always gon' be locked up
Hot stuff like Donna Summer, another number one-r
Comin' from the underground, this is how it's comin' down
Baby let me run it down: Mos Def, Talib
Kweli, Jane Doe, Punch, Word (ahem) E!
Excuse me, just ate another emcee
Sometimes that's just how it be
Partner wash you down with green tea and some lime
We like the five on the fist, fortified organized like this!

Drippings Of The Past,Pridebowl,"

Time, is like a burning candle flaming with light
Drippings of the past surround our future
Life, leaving only residue behind
The flame, the heart, the wick, the brain
The wax that covers it all
Protecting all the vital organs of time to come
As time melts away
As so does nature's course
A force, even a burning flame cannot escape
Time, candle like man's birth
Created for life on earth
Every memory takes form as does melted wax
Some memories they hang
The others, they only fall
The flame, the heart, the wick, the brain
The wax, protected all
Now nothing is left, but the organs of our lives
A force, even a burning candle cannot escape!
Life is like a burning candle
Just waiting to melt away

(Verse 1: Guttamouf)
Yeah, haha, we a’int nothing buta psychotic mother fuckers in here
I’m a equal opportunity cap buster
White, black, Spanish, it don’t matter
Sixteen make you cough up your gall bladder
Even if you a bitch, it means no different
It doesn’t matter if you wear bullet resistant
I smack mother fuckers and leave barrel imprints
I represent the mentally unstable
Who usually end up dead or in jail
While you get your coffin, I get lunch with Lucifer
Had breakfast with the grim reaper
Treat your body to a led diet
If you don’t shut the fuck up and be quiet
I’m God’s gift to your mother fucking photo
Spit on your photo, shit on your promo
With me running around, get a bullet proof do-rag
Portable IV and a mother fucking shit bag

(Chorus: Celph Titled)
Pull out the heat, it’s about to get dirty
No more rap shit, just heavy artillery
We the type of niggas that’s quick to blow your mug off
Serving mother fuckers beat downs with extra thug sauce

Pull out the heat, it’s about to get dirty
No more rap shit, just heavy artillery
We the type of niggas that’s quick to blow your mug off
Serving mother fuckers beat downs with extra thug sauce

(Verse 2: Majik Most)
Ay yo, I’m coming to your city and I’ll probably be
Rolling with a posse that will eat a homeless woman’s pussy
While playing Pavarotti they’ll be fishing your body
Out of Lake Erie in Michigan
With a Michelin tire wrapped around your midsection
I’m stepping on your corpse with a quart of your blood
All over my corduroys
While I bring the noise and, strict nine and poisons
Yeah, the type of shit I spit will leave you hollow in side
So mother fuck rap cats who can’t get live
I’m kicking hardcore lyrics till the age of 85
Until I retire, I’m only getting nicer
I’ll slam your fucking face down on a deli slicer
You’re crazy shook, rocking a Kevlar vest
A bullet took your head off and left a little piece of your neck
I need respect, I’m taking shit higher
Make you firearm backfire and light your arm on fire
You stupid bitch

(Chorus: Celph Titled)
Pull out the heat, it’s about to get dirty
No more rap shit, just heavy artillery
We the type of niggas that’s quick to blow your mug off
Serving mother fuckers beat downs with extra thug sauce

Pull out the heat, it’s about to get dirty
No more rap shit, just heavy artillery
We the type of niggas that’s quick to blow your mug off
Serving mother fuckers beat downs with extra thug sauce

(Verse 3: Celph Titled)
Watch how I run through your clique
And straight kill every homeboy
Y’all niggas softer than the Pillsbury doughboy
Fucking faggot, you eat dick nuggets and love it
Watching a Richard Simmons tape
And jack off after you dub it
Celph Titled is known to leave heads severally bleeding
And keep crack heads on my block fiending
If your rhymes are poisonous, I’ll make you eat your words
My gun talk money, imagine all the heat you could earn
Record a joint with me featuring you getting beat the fuck up
In a sound booth with a busted mics in front of your fucking wife
Rocking prosthetic limbs, your crew copped the boot leg
Call the police, you all shook daddy, nigga we two feds
Ain’t another spic realer than me
I give a fuck about hip hop, I’m just in it for cheese
And if this music don’t work, I’ll just find another hustle
You probably hate me for saying that shit so I say fuck you
I kick rhymes on mad records just cause I can
You wish to spit bars on vinyl, but you’ll never have fans
By the time you get a chance to have your first single out
My discography is countless with six figure amounts
The God Celph Titled, contested by no one
Niggas want to bring it, you can catch me at a show, dun
Fuck that, son who, gun you
Look what I done to, young crews that tried to come through
Niggas owe me loot, they turn up like rafts and canoes
I’m laughing at dude for thinking he as raw as my crew
From the NY boroughs and alleys to Hillsborough County
My name ring bells like free phone sex rallies
The Rubix Cuban, unsolvable
Shoot out the voice box of emcees and leave them inaudible
An entrepreneur, your crew rocking my line of body bags
In the Chrome Depot, we got shopping bags full of gats

(Chorus: Celph Titled)
Pull out the heat, it’s about to get dirty
No more rap shit, just heavy artillery
We the type of niggas that’s quick to blow your mug off
Serving mother fuckers beat downs with extra thug sauce

Pull out the heat, it’s about to get dirty
No more rap shit, just heavy artillery

Sherry's Living in Paradise,Kenny Chesney,"

[Verse 1]
Sherry's living in paradise
Slinging drinks at a bar down by the beach
And you know she came here from LA
Southern California could not hold her dreams
She's happy now it seems

[Chorus]
'Cause Sherry's living, living in paradise
Chasing something or running from something
Had a lot of lovers that were good for nothing
And she's thought about leaving once or twice
But she's still in the sun and this laid-back life
Sherry's living in paradise

[Verse 2]
Sherry's living in paradise
Somehow the salty air, it soothes her soul
Says it makes her whole
She gets hit on by the tourists
But she brushes it off 'cause she's heard every line
She just takes it in stride

[Chorus]
'Cause Sherry's living, living in paradise
Chasing something or running from something
Had a lot of lovers that were good for nothing
And she's thought about leaving once or twice
But she's still in the sun and this laid-back life
Sherry's living in paradise

[Outro]
She's thought about leaving once or twice
But she's still in the sun and this laid-back life

Pupillen weit und der Horizont auch
Nur chillen, weil ich hab Mollies im Bauch

Wander,Seedna,"

Ever since I took my first breath I've felt a constant desolation
Immured by society, alone in the crowd
Unlovely outcast, a wolf among sheep
The human race I abhor

I peel off my skin, showing what's hidden within; the bleeding truth, a soul of solitude
Rooted in my heart is pure despise and demise
Despise for you and I, demise for all our lives

I've had enough of this theater called life; happy facades, a constant masquerade
Hypocrites and feeble minds
You are fools lost in a life based on lies
Blind leading the blind deeper into the abyss, I am not going down with you

I am leaving this life behind
Into the night, into the dark, searching for a reason to keep on struggling

Night is silent, night is cold
Rays of light reflects from the moon, casting shadows at the side of my path
I feel the presence of what my eyes can't see
Spirits guiding me away from civilization

The silence is broken
I hear voices calling
From far beyond, whispering my name
A flash of light in the dark, mysterious specters lures me deeper into the woods

Here is no path to follow, I gaze up to the sky, witnessing the stars align
They are my guide in the darkest of times and keeps my inner spirit burning

The ghosts of past appears, dragging me down into a wormhole
My hands are reaching for the sky, I tremble in fear
Suffocating in mud, losing my vision
Blindly drifting, lost track of time and space
Groping through the pitch black darkness, ancient branches grabs my limbs
Lifts me up to the surface, the forest and I unite

I see a lake behind the trees, the forest is opening up
The water will quench my thirst
As I reach with my hands to the water I see a reflection
It is showing an old man, it is me
Wrinkled, scarred, a dying man
Searched for a reason, found my grave

Many years have passed since I wandered away, I spent my life searching for a reason
Wasted time that never will be given back

Here I am at the end of my journey, slowly breathing, taking a last breath of air
Laying down in this shallow grave, cover myself with the fallen leaves
Decay into earth, closing my eyes, drifting away
Entering eternal sleep
To the other side

Easy to Forget,Charlotte Church,"

It's late at night and you're not home
I'm still waiting for your call
But it never - it never comes
Do you ever think of me?
Can you hear my empty plea
For your love and affection?

I'll never know, I'll never know
Why I can't let go
It's what you do
Not what you say
That keeps you one step away
Am I that easy to forget?
If only you'd make one sacrifice
Do what it takes to make it alright
Am I that easy to forget?

I'm standing in the bitter cold
Wish that you were here to hold
'Cause I miss you
The way you used to be
Am I in this love alone?
When I speak, the words just fall
And you listen (but not to me)

Nel Getzemani
Gli ulivi s'incurvano
Grondanti di sangue

E fra i loro nodosi rami
Soltanto al pettirosso

È dato riporre la propria dimora

È nel nulla che risiede l'infinita essenza del cosmo
È nel nulla che l'infinito diviene misurabile

Il grido dell'uomo
Giace ormai sconfitto a terra
Devastato dalle lame del tempo

E non mi resta che raccogliere la mia ombra
Come una vecchia giacca maleodorante
Caduta alle mie spalle

È nel silenzio che risiede il concerto delle menti elette
È nel silenzio che ha inizio la genesi di ogni creazione

In troppi se lo sono dimenticato
L'oblio è il cancro della conoscenza

Ed ancora

È nel buio che risiede la magia d'ogni luce

Now you hate everything that I do
Yeah, we channeled all our energies and passion
That we used to use tryin' to make up
Now they're all empty words and endless fightin'
That we use as an excuse to not make love
Let's just let go, tryin' to hold on
And we both know we're already gone
Everyone knows once love goes bad
You can want it but you're never ever gonna get it back
Why should we fight and waste one more night?
Let's just let go
Girl, you know that it ain't that I don't love you
And deep down, I know you love me too
It's just we can't bridge this gap that's come between us
What's the use in tryin', we both know the truth
Let's just let go, tryin' to hold on
And we both know we're already gone
Everyone knows once love goes bad
You can want it but you're never ever gonna get it back
So why should we fight and waste one more night?
We could walk away right now and never stop
To look back
And all that we had
We could let go of our foolish pride
Forgive one another, give us one more try
'Cause everyone knows once love goes bad
You can want it but you're never ever gonna get it back
Why should we fight and waste one more night?
Let's just let go

Step aside as I come ripping through
Or fall victim like the countless many other do
A single move and get wasted by my crew
Swing the hammer with the force of a raging bull
I won't rest until the snap of your neck
Fuck the best and die like the rest
You better know I am built for war
Take your shots and make them count
I'll chew the bullets and spit them out

Not a pocket calculator

You're all washed up

Can't decide, 'cause there's no decision
Got no claim to any position

Start to confess it

8 Years of Silence,The Scene Aesthetic,"

I remember that day you left without notice
Abandoned your heart and your home
So I'm singing to break these eight years of silence
That I've learned to lead on my own
Feeling trapped even in my own skin
Are you what you dreamt of becoming?
The man I grew up with doesn't exist
In his place stands a sad hypocrite
And broken hearts aren't sewn together
With cheap empty words
This bridge burned such a long time ago
No signs of burnt wood, ashes, or coals
Had it all
Had it all here
But you left us and just disappeared
I guess when you've lied so many times
You create a false sense of the truth
Half the blood in my veins
Yes, sir, I hate to say
Half of that blood
It belonged to you
If there's one thing you can't seem to hide
It's that sickness you feel in your soul
I might be guilty of way too much pride
Would you believe that I learned it from you?
And broken hearts aren't sewn together
With cheap empty words
This bridge burned such a long time ago
No signs of burnt wood, ashes, or coals
Had it all
Had it all here
But you left us and just disappeared
The river once flowing has dried
Leaving nowhere for you to come home
Had it all
Had it all here
But you left us and just disappeared
You left us and just disappeared
Disappeared
Disappeared
This bridge burned such a long time ago
No signs of burnt wood, ashes or coals
Had it all
Had it all here
But you left us and just disappeared
The river once flowing has dried
Leaving nowhere for you to come home
Had it all
Had it all here
But you left us and just disappeared
You left us and just disappeared

On that great day when he cracks the sky
When the world hears the trumpet sound And the dead begin to rise
I wonder how it would be
Will I be walking down the street?
Will it happen right in the middle of the day
Or at night while I'm asleep?

[Chorus:]
All I know is I want to be ready
I want to be ready
And I want you to say well done
I just want you to say well done

I can already see the signs
Each day the world is getting worse
It seems the earth itself is crying out
For someone to rescue her
The days are getting shorter
The years are passing by
It's like I see the Lord preparing Himself to come and get His bride

All I know is I want to be ready
I want to be ready
And I want you to say well done
I just want you to say well done

But let's be mindful as we pursue our dreams
And as we pursue our goals
That at the end of all this
The reality is I'm living my whole life
Just to hear two words
And that's well done

Split her in half like it's magic

Stick out her tongue for the acid

Ich stürm deine Wohnung mit 300 Kanaks

You Are Okay,Vroom,"

I've been reading what they say in the news
Hoping that I hear back from you
I wrote you this letter of explanation
A look at things from my point of view

It's a matter of supply and demand
Field research and capital gains
Success is just a product of sex and money
I've got the looks; they've got the brains

It's a necessary part of the job
Get maybe just a little involved
But most of our dealings were strictly business
I just wanted to know

If' you're okay and it's all right

Everybody's talking about
Who's with who and who's making out
Wouldn't we be better off making music
Instead of all this sleeping around?

Cause everyone here has a mistress
It's such a dirty business
If we put our heads together
The songs will live forever
I gotta get out of this hell-hole
I'm packing my things and I'm coming home

You're okay and it's alright
You're okay, is this alright
If I put my hand on your thigh?

But if it's okay then it's alright with me

In You is the fountain
Moving the mountains
Parting the oceans
Always in motion

The cost of redemption
Paying the ransom
Leaving me speechless
Turning me inside out

To heaven without watering
So is my word and it will not return

And be led forth in peace

Mis lágrimas cayendo hacia el cielo

Déjame morir, nada para mí God
Déjame morir
Nada para mí, déjame morir God
Déjame morir

[Verso 1]
Déjame morir, all fo' the ki
Ella no quiso que escapáramos lejos de aquí
Y ahora con los ladrones como cristo hasta el fin
Poco, poco, poco más me queda pa' mi

Ella buscaba escapar, yo no lo supe ni ver
Estaba por mí y ya no va a volver
La vida ya no me tardo en devolver
Soy dolor de mañana y ayer
Ese brillo que no va a volver
Describo colores que no pueden ver

Escupo lágrimas o me las trago por si
Desperdicio lo que tengo y se derrama el juicy
Yo rezaba cada noche agonizando por si
No quería que lloraras pero yo morir sí

No recuerdo cuando no estábamos presos
Ni del momento en el que dejamos de fingir
Ni aquel ocho de enero, el primer beso
Nos miramos a los ojos antes de morir

All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, seguimos estando presos
Madworld, midnight expresso
Esta puta ansiedad me está quitando peso

No sé si está ahí arriba o estoy solo
Me mate y pulso la Z mientras daba Ctrl
Y ella estaba lejos como el sol, no hay alcohol
Yo me sigo consumiendo como el Nissan Repsol

Mis fantasmas aún buscan consuelo
Por todo mi sistema malware
Mis lágrimas cayendo hacia el cielo

Baby It's Cold Outside,Virginia to Vegas,"

[Alyssa Reid, Virginia To Vegas]
I really can't stay
Baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away
Baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry
But beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well maybe just a half a drink more
Put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby don't hold out

[Alyssa Reid & Virginia To Vegas]
Oh, but it's cold outside

[Alyssa Reid, Virginia To Vegas]
I simply must go
Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no
But baby, it's cold outside
This welcome has been
I'm lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
And brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh, your lips are delicious
Well, maybe just another drink more
Never such a blizzard before

I've got to get home
Baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see?
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my lifelong sorrow
Well at least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that old out

Angelic Encounters,Thanatos,"

(Lead:Paul)

(Chorus)
Cold winds blowing, darkness fills the skies
Fear is showing, panic in your eyes
Unknown forces, from the heavens above
Evil spirits, angelic shapes sent to destroy

Shapes of beauty, souls of rage
Released from heaven's golden gates
Their anger suppressed 2,000 years
Hypocrisy is running through their veins

The angels...are out for your blood
They cry out...a declaration of war
A war...to wipe out mankind
All evil...unleashed in this night

(lead:Paul)

(Repeat chorus)
Believers raise their hands up to the skies
Not realizing their faith is based on lies
Awaiting the arrival of their lord
Unknowing they'll be utterly destroyed

(Repeat 2nd verse)
The believers finally realize
The False One eternally idolized
Too late to fight the hand of fate
You're exposed to God's unholy rage

Nie powinna przysłodzić i pociechy mało w niej

Już od rana, przez cały dzień
Z łokcia, z kolana w łeb wpycha się
I każdej nocy aż po świt
Włazi oknami, wciska przez drzwi

A czasem miękcej bo nie ma co kryć
Że bez serducha nie ma po co żyć

Put your hands to the horizon and touch the sky x4

[Verse 1: NYX]
No minutes spared
No moments wasted
Another one gone, but another ones racing
By our line of site; blank spaces
Connected by rays of light, we're chasing
Success, not necessarily limelight
Although if the time's right
I'd like my time to shine bright
Like a blazing comet in the sky high
Touch the clouds as I fly by (fly by)

It's a notch on the belt that we're making
No waiting, we're taking music that we made and
Placing a larger meaning on its face then
Gracing the world with its meaning
It's amazing what we made in
Such a short amount of time
And we'll keep making just greater
Whether we're under the radar or get famous
It's a gift to show one or a million that we made this

Got the windows rolled down as I ride through the country
Radio cranked while I'm lookin' for some company
Eyes peeled for somewhere I can turn loose
Bonfire Willie, stack the wood where I can burn through
Now I can get a little wild and crazy by myself
But it's a little more fun when I got some help
So help wanted, submit your application
Experience a person and engage in a conversation
Dirt road ridin' in them lifted high toys
Commin' 'round the bend with them Tennessee Shine boys
Goin' strong, rooster crowin' in the mornin'
Hangin' out the window while yellin' help wanted

I need a drinkin' buddy
A girl that ain't afraid to get that ass a little muddy
Someone willin' to backroad from here to Kentucky
At a moments notice just 'cause I'm feelin' lucky
I'm lookin' for an angel with Devilish features
Weekends a stripper, weekdays a teacher
A surgeon with a pistol ready to perform procedure
A girl that likes that music loud enough to blow the speakers
A lady in the streets, a freak on a dirt road
Can't keep her in a seat, she up on a console
Got the cooler in the bed where the Natty's ice cold
And she's climbin' out to get 'em through the back window
I know, I know my criteria is unreachable
But the way you lookin' right now we could do the unspeakable
I told her ""Get dressed, baby girl you're hired""
She said ""I need a hand these jeans fresh out the dryer""

Trapped behind the walls
And it's something you defend

Pain is in your eyes
You're holding back the tears
So why is it that you pretend?

And all this time you've hidden the abuse
But now you have a way out
It's your life, just choose

So afraid but not for long
You'll brave the sea despite the waves
Now it's time to shear your fears
And trough them all away
You braved the sea despite the waves

Walked amongst the shadows
Through the chilling air of dusk
Once again, but not alone

Waiting all your life for destiny
To shatter these four walls
And set, you free

So afraid but not for long
You'll brave the sea despite the waves
Now it's time to shear your fears
And trough them all away
You braved the sea despite the waves

Visions in deep sleep
Racing through the mind
Will he ever dream again?

Visions in deep sleep
So vivid and serene
How he wants to dream again

We blink our eyes
Time flies by we don't know
What ever happened to those childhood years?

Aim for the stars above those city lights

Have you watched your dreams slip away?

And every dreamer dreams again
Got to dream again

El xicot, gens poca-solta
Ha trobat per tal atzucac la solució
S'ha fet un tall al braç esquerre
Per on hi entra un cable amb terra
Que connecta els nervis amb l'ordinador

I així s'acaben els problemes
Fotent-hi fils, piuets i antenes
USBs i quatre arxius amb autorun
Oh! Que fantàstica és la ciència
Si el xicot per la consciència
El windows fa Apagar Equipo i tururut!

Problema segon

La següent part d'aquesta història
Es centra amb la companya Glòria
Amb greus problemes per establir connexió
Amb els nois de la discoteca
Que es salten la xerrameca
I van directes a la colonització

Ella s'arrapa a la columna
I balla al son del txumba-txumba
Amb desparpajo impropi de la seva edat
Preguntareu ""Per què està sola?
I Per què ningú li diu hola?""
Molt senzill: Perquè el seu nas fa feredat!

Solució segona

Schoenmaker compta amb gran prestigi
Com a metge és un prodigi
De la cirurgia amb tots els seus vessants
Treballa ràpid i molt fi
A cop de serra, bisturí
Novocaïna i sutura auto-degradant

L'operació va de primera
Tot i el mal que no s'espera
Quan li parteixen el nas per la meitat
Però tot i això ella no protesta
Fora els punts, se'n va de festa
I es pentina un fashion victim musculat

Problema tercer

Per anar tancant la trilogia
Parlem d'en Josep Maria
Una persona acostumada a viure amb por
Que no creu que hi hagi algú noble
Del Perú a Constantinoble
I desconfia fins i tot del més senyor

Sempre llegeix en els diaris
Periodistes visionaris
Que prediuen la debacle d'aquest món
Per talibans
Canvis climàtics, boits que enriqueixen urani
Terroristes i immigrants de qui sap on

Solució Tercera

Cal fer quelcom i ben de pressa
Fot als fills un GPS
I a la dona la disfressa de soldat
Es munta un bunker al garatge
Al carter agafa d'hostatge
Toc de queda i càstig pels que arriben tard

Reconverteix la segadora
En una gran metralladora
Per si hi ha algun extraterrestre pel veïnat
Ja s'ha acabat el preocupar-se
Visca el món i visca el Barça
Catalans la millor vida ja ha arribat

Liquid crystals on his watch catch rays of morning peeking through
Moving the pillows out of the way. Tries to make the time
Falls asleep with his watch on again

I spent the night in the forest
You were shining when I cried
When I cried:
""Oh where is the light?""

I spent all my days in my mindscape
You were with me
When I weapt
When I weapt
You watched me when I slept

Skies have grown darker
But stars have grown brighter
And my room
And my room is a safe cocoon!

Streets have gone misty
But peace is upon me when I sing
When I sing:
""Holy is the King!""

And You won't wash away if I fade
And it's OK to break in two

If I'm breaking into you!

You won't wash away if I fade

That pussy all on my regimen
We just stay true to our etiquettes
I got the keys ima resident
Handle my business that's evident
Work day and night I'm the president
I got the stripes like a veteran

No frauds in my circle
We tighter than draws
Fans in Fresno that'll merk you
Ace on my side
Slept on his floor
Now we just LIV in the V.I.P
Kalease on the line
Push pride to the side
Throw her the keys to the whip
No time for jealousy
You move around with hoe tendencies
We did not grow up the same
I can not give you my empathy
Look back on how far I came
I took the plane not the train
This is my life and shawty looking like she need her a new role to play
Aye

Non trovo mai quello che cerco
Se non mi diverto
Mi chiedo perché stiamo insieme
Tutto è diverso, a gonfie vele

Nel letto la pace, il letto è di fuoco
Ed io lo so che tanto

Non mi arrendo e grido se mi dici no

Come close your eyes at last and wake yourself from evil dreams

Together we’ll escape so take my hand and let us fly to Shpongleland
Together we will float away away

[Verse 1: Ezra Henderson]

I’m next in the spot let’s face it
I’ma kill the game and then I’m gonna change it
I was a kid with a dream so I chased it
Running for the throne, keep on going till I take it
They see me headed for the top and they hate it
But they’re just mad I’m in their girlfriend’s playlist
Going in on a beat cause I made it
But now I think I’ll bring the melody and the bass in
Triple threat so you know the beat bang
Singer, producer, writer, it’s all the same name
We ain’t in the same league, I’m a different game
Cause I’m puttin' in the work, and you work for the fame
I do not know what you think you just heard
You're bumping average, but this is absurd
Told you I’m headed for greatness, I’m sure
So now you should probably start marking my words

[Chorus: Ezra Henderson]

I’m tired of trying to figure out who I should be
Music is my best friend and my enemy
At least I got my fans they’ll always ride with me
And if they sleeping on us, let ‘em rest in peace

[Verse 2: Ezra Henderson]

I don’t know what you think I came here for
I mean a Grammy would be nice but I want more
I never take a hater’s advice, so therefor
I got my opinion, I don’t need yours
My team is winning take a look up at the scoreboard
My fans are with me and we’re selling out the Fillmore
If you ain’t riding with us yet, you get ignored
But you’ll come running when you see us on the Billboard
This is for every single person that told me I’ll never make it
This is for every time you called me Justin Bieber, I embraced it
Yeah, cause as far as I can see you’re working hourly minimum wages
Huh, and I’m working stages, the girls at these shows they all know what my name is

I can teach you how to dance, how to sing, how to knit
How to make things that you never ever made before
Enid, I can teach you how to use cookie cutters
To make crazy things out of Play-Doh

Little houses, little farms, little accessories for your mom
For your Barbie set, for your friends and your family

Do you remember
How it started way back then?
There were love songs on the radio
And music became a friend

Who'd have believed it?
But the melodies linger on
They gave us inspiration
And kept us going on

They said that all you need is love (all you need is love)
Now we remember yesterday (yesterday)
The message was in the songs
And the feelings were so strong
They sounded good - they still sound good today

Through the years we dreamed our dreams together
We hoped and prayed and some of them came true
Through the years our memories live forever
And like the music, we made it strong

Do you remember fairy tales? (fairy tales)
The hero reaches for his queen
Whatever your hopes and fears
Your laughter and your tears
The feelings just get stronger through the years

We hoped and prayed and some of them came true
Through the years our memories live forever

An eight-seater, rollin' ten niggas deep
With five chicks and niggas in the back in the Jeep
Cruisin' the streets, word, get down, to the beat
You don't stop til them niggas lick shots
At the dance with a new dance, this is how we rock
When we drop, showin' y'all that we just can't stop

We don't say ""You know what I'm sayin'?""
We say ""Man, the shots sprayin'""
For the niggas in the back (Clap, clap)
See me with the new rap attack, in fact
It's like that, at all times when I rhyme good
Rep every hood, North ??? to the wood
Then back to the streets and adapt, we maintain
I maim whack cats standin' at a close range
Tryin' to show y'all people that it ain't a game

See I ain't finished stickin' the dick in your crotch, bitch
Now sit and watch, bitch
Another notch, you turnin' my shit up and rock
A little too eager to drop (C'mon, what!)
So, let's do it a bit quicker and split up your knot
A short circuit, like an electrical shock
So say it to shepherd niggas, so say it to flock (C'mon!)
Before I send a bitch to go take what you got
Actin' like he didn't know the bitch, then you must have forgot, bitch
Rip up a nigga, stick up and kick up a nigga
It could be a million dudes, go rally your clique up my nigga (C'mon!)
Before we make you want to go ditch on your niggas
Switch on them niggas, before we bring the bitch out of you niggas

Snake eyes on dice for y’all, shoulders on ice for y’all (frozen)
8-6 all the hate, I won’t get involved today
Got lost in the bolognese, I'm flippin the bars
Im flippin’ the, flippin’ the, flippin’ the
On record off record I still count wins when they doubt it
On record off record I let em take advantage I was wildin'
On record off record deals, tell em talk to Collin for the quote
On record off record I still want the ac not the ghost
Runnin' through it with the young influence
Adolescent pressures, I’m succumbing to it
I’ve been giving yes’s when I shouldn’t do it
I complete objectives, but the move’s illusive
And I’m barely movin' but I’m still gone boost ‘em
I can’t work on winnings when I know you’re losin'
So I work their winnings and they throw the deuces
Guess I have to pivot, shooting “No” bazookas for the
Facts I need racks, paper cash, fuck a tax
That’s a joke tell em laugh, Uncle Sam, fuck out the bag
Rollie plot, with Getto Wack, contract, gimme the max
I got Labb on my back you ain’t that then it’s wraps

Ta til fornuft og puste frisk luft

Jeg vil så gjerne gå ut å titte
Du lar meg bare sitte for du er en

Som kan holde din stand

Og det gjør så vondt at jeg ikke kan forstå

Er det fordi jeg er litt feit?

Can you take me home
Can't stand to watch you leave

When the sky is darker than my mind can reach

No shelter in a hurricane

Nothing broke but I still feel pain

Please tell me it will all be okay

They whisper like wind
Who is left to trust?
Drinks won't fill you up
Golden hearts turn to rust

Then please don't waste my time
Death doesn't mean quiet
When I'm silent I'm alive

Fight me anyway

IN FOR THE KILL (Hensley/R.Medlocke/Spires)

I've been standing on the edge
A little too long
Waiting for the door to be opened
Hanging on the brink biding my time
Wonderin' if the spell would be broken
Seen a million words of wisdom lost
In the wind heard the voices
Of the desperate and the dreamers
And I knew that any moment
They'd be callin' my name
To see if I was ready for the game

So I'm movin' movin' in the for kill
Got a date with a man
Who says he'll watch me fall
Gotta take this chance
I'm movin' in for the kill
This time I'm gonna have it all

The title's in my pocket
The ideas in my head
I'm lookin' for a little inspiration
It isn't just the money
That gets me outta bed
I've got to have a little motivation
I ain't got no brand illusions
I'm better than the rest
There's a fire in my heart
That makes me wanna be the best
My finger's on the trigger
Know what I wanna be
And everything is ready
As far as I can see

Movin' in for the kill
Movin' in for the kill
Ah, I'm movin' in for the kill
Movin' in for the kill
Movin' in for the kill
This time I'm gonna have it all
I'm movin' in

Green money that'll fold, crack sales had slowed
I was told hoes exposed stay on their toes
Drug dealer money froze, stashed right in his nose
Shot friends that was bros, crossed the street code
Opportunist, yeah we're cool but ain't the newest
Dropped out of school but knew I should've pursued this
Action affirmative, observative
You vs me, that's cool we call it murder biz
So tell 'em what it's supposed to be
You can't front on me gripping on rosary
Yeah... you see our actions is backed off
When we back off we let that mac off
Tell them niggas vamous and watch 'em back off

I'm always in the trap getting packs off
I got tonnes of the coke, you selling bath salts
Come through in a Porsche with a bad broad
'Cause every time I get dressed I rip tags off
The type of bitches that I fuck you need a passport
'Cause you the broke niggas saying it's your man fault
But that's what happens when you running for a hand off
You keep it real when you visit niggas up north
Me and N.O.R.E. getting high in a G4
Your wife say it's work, it's really just a day off
I'm a boss in these streets, you getting laid off
And the jewellery on my neck, you thought I play ball
Look you in your face nigga, who's soft?
Coke get delivered on a U-Haul
You got famous getting smacked on World Star

Nigga that's your girl house
And I can make this bitch kick you the fuck out

On your mark, get ready, set, go
All city, Nate rep the metro
Kind of nigga that get drunk and stay lit
Straight killing I increase the death toll
Still getting texts from ex hoes
Like what up stranger and x o's
I only fuck with Whatsapp and Snapchat
Fake niggas get slapped up and clapped at
To the coroner, fresh bags of toe tags
Competition crack like it's snow craft
Then it's back to Queens to get more guns
We like Harlem Nights shooting a small gun
Bullets busting through the glass of the store front
And when it's time for bail the boss cough up
No matter if it's cash or cheque
We peel fast and we usually keep cash on deck

Slum vandal, hand on a gun handle
And these streets so deep right to the slums manhole
Fiends run up, come get it I bump samples
Made the block so hot niggas done brung camels
Corners pop off [?] some candles
Play with your life you're losing in one gamble
Never forseen to be the leader of a drug market
Swimming in a green crib with the plush carpet
Life ain't peaches and cream, it's a tough harvest
You need a gun harness, you need a cut artist
You need a little some part of it and bus chartered
You need the cut gardens
You need to get your hands dirty, either touch garbage
You need a tough squadron, you need to buck targets
You need a team of killers, you gotta clean the scrilla

The mimes become its food

In human gore imbued

Out - out are the lights - out all!

While the angels all pallid and wan

And I'll be still with you tonight

Humming the sweet melody
I just wanna know that you love me
And I'll be as good as can be

Oh, tomorrow you know I must leave you (Ahh)

So, kiss me and say it's forever
And then take me up to your room

Come lay by my side, turn out the lights

And now theres no one quite like you There's no one quite like me

Don't worry bout the weather cool you down with some ice tea
You ain't gotta fight me baby you just like me baby you just

Stop it bleeding alone

La mona Jacinta
Se ha puesto una cinta
Se peina, se peina
Y quiere ser reina
Ay, no te rías de sus monerías

Mas la pobre mona
No tiene corona
Tiene una galera
De hoja de higuera
Ay, no te rías de sus monerías

Un loro bandido
Le vende un vestido
Un manto con plumas
Y un collar de espumas
Ay, no te rías de sus monerías

Al verse en la fuente
Dice alegremente:
""Qué mona preciosa
Parece una rosa""
Ay, no te rías de sus monerías

Levanta un castillo
De un solo ladrillo
Rodeado de flores
Y sapos cantores
Ay, no te rías de sus monerías

La mona cocina
Con leche y harina
Prepara la sopa
Y tiende la ropa
Ay, no te rías de sus monerías

Su marido mono
Se sienta en el trono
Sus hijas monitas
En cuatro sillitas
Ay, no te rías de sus monerías

Another missing number in the jungle
Turned up with nothing but a loincloth to protect your tender penis from what's danger in the wildlife
Hushing your blood to hear a grass blade break
Beneath live them fang, where the edible are thread
A clump of thieves' teeth are hung, strung around your neck
Book of matches in your left hand. Something sharp in your right
Fact: When one first arms themselves to kill, they will be lucky to fall, even the old or the ill

And while the killing will grow easy, it will never grow less complicated
Why, what kind of killer are you?
Did you dig through its death unflinchingly?
Or did you just shut your breath and survive?
What kind of killer are you? Did you decide?
You'd rather starve than go on taking this day?
Does a bachelor's degree arm one as it guts its prey?

Did you still feel deathful?

When one first (h)arms themselves to kill, they will be lucky to fall, even the old or the ill

Killa'! Is you is, or is you ain't?

Will you always eat around the wishbone or thank the carcass you're carving for what's all destruction?
And do you still feel deathful with only matches, weapon, and less questions?
Would you now dissolve small slices of unraveled human arm on your good tongue?
Or would you now dig past your sausage stomach from the rungs of the ill over the young?
And is this the fork to which you've come, a choice where there is none?
Knowing only to survive is quite deathful in the one dusk of what's done
And so I ask, what kind of killer are you or will you become?

Did you dig through its death unflinchingly?

Pretend you're not even there
And if Market Management says so
Well, take cover behind your chair

You know, you're running down the wrong track
When they're only willing to pay
When you sell things to kids who cannot
Tell the difference between shit and clay

And who told the boss that you were
Tinkering with the fax machine
A few minutes before it broke down
And that you quickly left the crime scene

A few paper balls and a dustbin
Why not try something else instead?
Your body fluids still float freely
And there's a cam above your head

Put every paper in the shredder
Destroy everything that was
It's about time you stop working
For someone else's cause

You shout ""From now on it's my own dreams!""
""I have overcome my fears""
And when you convey the message
You watch your family burst into tears

Superman Can't Move His Legs (Demo 2003),​a balladeer,"

Skipping streets in springtime
Chasing sunlight on my bike
And I could chalk the sidewalk
Any color that I liked

Blowing dandelions
Fairground rides and climbing trees
And mother's kiss or candy
For every injured knee

There are no action heroes out there
To come and save the world from harm
Superman can't move his legs
And I can't use my arms

Superman can't move his legs

Grandma's cake and candles
Magic bean plants in a jar
Shared baths and bedtime stories
From Prickly Leg to Matthew Star

Sleeping Beauty's sleeping
I’m not the boy I used to be
Surrounded by the bad guys
The only fairy here is me

There are no action heroes out there
To come and save the world from harm
Superman can't move his legs
And I can't use my arms

Superman can't move his legs

I don't know much but
If I've learned something from the past
It's: girls go for assholes
And happy endings never last

There are no action heroes out there
To come and save the world from harm
Superman can't move his legs
And I can't use my arms

Superman can't move his legs

Captain Fun (feat. John Martin),Sam Lachow,"

[Intro: Sam Lachow]
Party, party, party
We're killers and life savers
Drug dealers intermingle with pimps and gang bangers
And haters hatin' the chains and things cuz they can't afford 'em
The players looking for pussy, the pussy looking for Captain Morgan
Who got the captain in em?
I'm laughing at battle rappers, iffy dumb rhymes , and sometimes a punch line
It's crunch time, can you hear it?
It's lookin' like trouble and smellin' like teen spirit

[Verse 1: Sam Lachow]
Blowing weed and lighting fire to paper
Rolled a couple extra cuz we'll be lightin' 'em later
Now someone hide the weed cuz I'm busy hiding the Jäger
Now I'm dealing with police and apologizing to neighbors
Like, ""I'm fucking sorry man, it won't happen again
I know it's 2 a.m., I'll start kicking out all my stupid friends
The kids are alright, we just having a fun night
Matter fact, fuck that! We're gon' party to sunrise!
A bunch of dumb guys just doing what kids do
I know a bunch of years ago you was a kid too
So take a trip and come and hang with all the boys
And you can't pick another night that you complain about the noise
Bitch!""
Hahaha!
This one goes out to D.A.P
What up [?], I see you
Alright, look
Let's bring the beat back in, c'mon

[Verse 2: John Martin]
Walked in, leaned back, full glass, [?]
Six-pack, weed sack, I'm fly boy, SEA-TAC
Manuever like a pooper-scooper, my music the shit
So what it dookie? I don't believe that we've met, I'm gone
[?]
I'm so amazing, we made it
The mini van that we came in was so stuffed
When we got out there was circus music playing, what up!
Sorr-ay to break up the soirée
But I've had a long day, where the fuck's [?]
The hallway full so I hit the back porch
Sat at the back door like ""Can I hit that [?]""
[?]
We just came to wake the neighbors up

All Hail King Jesus (Live),UPPERROOM,"

[Chorus]
All hail, King Jesus
All hail the Lord of heaven and earth
All hail, King Jesus
All hail the Savior of the world

[Verse 1]
There was a moment when the lights went out
When death had claimed its victory
The King of love had given up His life
The darkest day in history

[Verse 2]
There on a cross they made for sinners
For every curse His blood atoned
One final breath and it was finished
But not the end we could have known

[Pre-Chorus 1]
For the earth began to shake, and the veil was torn
What sacrifice was made, as the heavens roared

[Chorus]
All hail, King Jesus
All hail the Lord of heaven and earth
All hail, King Jesus
All hail the Savior of the world

[Verse 3]
There was a moment when the sky lit up
A flash of light breaking through
When all was lost He crossed eternity
The King of life was on the move

[Pre-Chorus 2]
For in a dark, cold tomb, where our Lord was laid
One miraculous breath, and we're forever changed

[Chorus]
All hail, King Jesus
All hail the Lord of heaven and earth
All hail, King Jesus
All hail the Savior of the world
All hail, King Jesus
All hail the Lord of heaven and earth
All hail, King Jesus
All hail the Savior of the world

[Bridge]
Let every knee, come bow before the King of kings
Let every tongue, confess that He is Lord
Lift up your shout, let us join with all of heaven
Singing ho-ho-ho-ho-holy
Singing ho-ho-ho-ho-holy
Crying out ho-ho-ho-ho-holy
Singing ho-ho-ho-ho-holy

[Chorus]
All hail, King Jesus
All hail the Lord of heaven and earth
And all hail, King Jesus
All hail the Savior of the world

[Post-Chorus]
All hail, King Jesus
All hail, King Jesus
All hail, King Jesus
All hail, King Jesus!

[Chorus]
All hail, King Jesus
All hail the Lord of heaven and earth
All hail, King Jesus
All hail the Savior of the world
All hail, King Jesus
All hail the Lord of heaven and earth
All hail, King Jesus

Dallas,The Felice Brothers,"

Ocean of stars, why’ve I gone so far?
I miss my home
I hear those engines drone
The runway is set
Let’s move this fucking jet, I have to go
Despite all the sleet and snow

Just a late night host leaving Dallas
With a portrait done in velvet
Just a three night run at the palace
And i’ve never in my life felt so alone

I worked for the show
Stars would come and go
I worked the lights
I even swept some nights
But now i’m the host that’s worthy of a toast
Don’t you agree my little honeybee

Just a late night king leaving Dallas
With a portrait done in velvet
Just a three night run at the palace
I’ll be at 17th and Broadway by tonight

So far away from all these wonders
Even as the roulette spins
I was escorted seventeen miles
Came upon all winds bend
Even in dreams of light
I can still hear her call through the tall grass and weeds
And i know i’ll never be the same on this road to calvary

Just a late night host leaving Dallas
With a portrait done in velvet
Just a three night run at the palace
And I never in my life felt so alone
And I never in my life felt so alone

In the coldest night, can you feel it
Burning bright or do you want to?
I'm the same as you, not quite sure
Just what to do or what to feel like
But everytime I hear your name
I wring my hands and mumble
I guess I'll try and write a letter
Say goodbye and just forget her

Ah, but you know I can't forget her 'cos
Maybe it's you, maybe it's me
Maybe it's you who's always right
Maybe it's me who's doing time

Well you should know there's a place
Inside my heart that's always empty
Oh and I'm not blind though I wish
I were sometimes to ease the anger
But everytime I hear your name
I wring my hands and mumble
You know the woman drive me crazy
When she makes it seems so easy
But you know I can't give in
Because

Maybe it's you who's always right

All These Little Cowboys,Cory Branan,"

From a famous tattered sleeve
He pulls the ace of innocence
Kills another fifth of Whiskey
Swears it's self defense
He stares down the big bar mirror
Almost a tear in his eye
One last quick-draw with the bottle
What a tired way to die

All these little cowboys
Making the scene
Screaming 'Bloody Mary'
Into their answering machines
They're all suckers for a heartache
They sleep on sticks-n-stones
All these little cowboys
Can't leave bad enough alone

Now the 8-ball's just a chaser
For the Demerol and speed
All you could ever ask for
Is never all they need
So they settle for the bottom
And they make for the door
All these little cowboys
Break like someone's keeping score

All these little cowboys
Making the scene
Screaming 'Bloody Mary'
Into their answering machines
They're all suckers for a heartache
They sleep on sticks-n-stones
All these little cowboys
Can't leave bad enough alone

Now his boots are caked with stardust
And she's soaked his shirt in tears
All his shit's out on the front lawn
It's the best time he's felt in years
Cause now its home no the range
And it's home on the dash
Nowhere's where the heart is
He just needs a place to crash

All these little cowboys
Making the scene
Screaming 'Bloody Mary'
Into their answering machines
They're all suckers for a heartache
They sleep on sticks-n-stones
All these little cowboys
Can't leave bad enough alone

At the end of it all
We stand transparent
Destroying the burden
To sustain
Leaving no piece
To remain

The dead never leave
They live on in what they conceive
What was born in our time
Will not be mourned or unwind

Unfit we are
You've shared your worth
So we could receive
What we did not deserve

A debt you will bear
A cost to be shared
As a living sacrifice
Spliced from our lives

Endowed to those who shared their worth
So we could partake in what we did not deserve

[Strofa 1]
Il vagone in metro è troppo pieno
E non so se aspettare il prossimo
Le porte chiudono e passi attraverso
Ma io non faccio in tempo
E mi lasci da solo qui come uno scemo, come uno scemo
Le mani combaciano per un momento
Ma divise dal vetro

[Pre-Ritornello]
Ho più di qualche bottiglia da scolare
Perché ho più di qualche sbaglio da scordare
Forse sono fatto male
E sono rimasto solo a quanto pare
Speravo in un finale da film americano
Ma andava bene uguale anche un finale dolceamaro
Con il mondo che crolla e noi due mano nella mano
Su un cielo di salsa di soia e nuvole di drago

[Ritornello]
E ti direi che resti mia pure che sei di un altro
Ma è solo una bugia
E il vento si porterà via questo giorno distratto
E la malinconia
E ti direi che resti mia pure che sei di un altro
Ma è solo una bugia
E il vento si porterà via questo giorno distratto
E la malinconia

[Strofa 2]
Ed è passato tutto quanto di punto in bianco
Mi parlano e sento soltanto rumore bianco
Pensieri mi corrono appresso, tengono banco
Accelero il passo per tenerli lontano
Ho tagliato la barba per sembrarti un altro
Per sembrarti cambiato, come volevi tu
Mi confido col barman che ne versa un altro
Ma non mi sta ascoltando come facevi tu
Bevo liquore trasparente per diventare invisibile
Nel tuo sguardo è cambiato qualcosa, qualcosa di impercettibile
È meglio far finta di niente e restare impassibile
E sei irraggiungibile, era prevedibile

Hay futuro en el camino
A pesar de la distancia
Muy cerca te siento, amigo
Por eso te doy las gracias

(Verso 1)
Voy a comenzar por decir lo que es verdad
No es casualidad, la autoridad no me soporta
Les caigo mal porque saben que no tengo lengua corta
Molestan todo el día para que me jale otra torta
A mi no me importa, al genero nada le aporta
Son peces payasos y yo soy una ballena orca
A punta de pichazos le cierro la boca a Porta
Porque ya llegó el playaso que a las bases ahorca
Andrei no se comporta, Andrei dice lo que quiere
Sea sexo, plata, mujeres o el juicio de Figueres
Yo sé que se mueren por hacer un feat con Zarcort
Pero las palabras hieren cuando vengo modo hardcore
Yo no soy un narco pero vengo con mil líneas adictivas
RImas radioactivas, lo estoy mirando desde arriba
Tomo la iniciativa para que no se prohiba
Lo que yo escriba con mi lengua ofensiva
Mi lapicero se desgasta más y más cada día
Abriendo a estos raperos como una colonoscopía
Letras tan parecidas que parecen homófonos
Pero yo les cambio la vida, solo denme el micrófono
Anglófono no soy pero manejo el idioma
Con el beat hago maromas, si soy como una neuroma
A mi me dieron un diploma por más que dejarle en coma
Que mi flow carcoma todas sus malditas cromosomas
Toma, nunca podrán con Andrei, el rey
El que maneja el track, el puto crack, el que es la ley
El sensei de artes verbales, el que parte instrumentales
El que pisa tu confianza y te deja daños fatales
PRA PRA PRA! Se murieron, nunca vieron
Y siguieron retando a su alteza y majestad
YA SE VAN! MC entero donde quiero y soy certero
Cuando hiero su cabeza con mi rap

Hay cientos como ustedes y ninguno como yo
Hay cientos como ustedes y ninguno como yo
Hay cientos como ustedes y ninguno como yo

Iniciales AGC, o sea, aléjese

Yo que sé, solo son mediocres para mi
Salen en Movimiento Urbano y ya se creen MC’s
Suben el videito con una pésima estética
Juegan de vivos y solo pueden con letras tétricas
Reparo con descaro, en Dios me amparo y no paro
Vio, imbécil? También puedo hacer sus métricas
No tienen estilo ni originalidad
Son la copia de una copia y esa es la realidad
La verdad, siendo serio, no me pienso comparar
A una falta de criterio que es tan espectacular
Un gol angular de una a su yugular
No hay lugar, cuando tiro con mucha velocidad
Dad-dadme tus textos, no quiero defectos, efectos perfectos
Te dejo en el recto si rimas conecto y te las inyecto con toda esta calidad

No soy buen freestyler por lo que veo
Pero tráiganme un papel y a todos me los culeo
Los estoy matando, al mismo tiempo dando un show
Están alucinando, quedan como Ñengo Flow
Que soy arrogante? Si, me lo han dicho antes
A la Coca Cola pienso que somos muy semejantes
Somos queridos por la gente, pero no obstante
Yo soy una en el desierto y ustedes de restaurante
Pa’ delante los pedantes, es que Vegas no es cantante
Cuando se trata de rap yo soy el puto comandante
Ignorantes soy letal como Michael Owen

Sin ventas están, inventan sus fans
Y juegan de pipis porque tienen unas Vans

Like some Russian dolls in fact
Quick to rush and cop a sack

People waiting for some kind of sign from above
Lost in the shadows of doubt, need a message of love
Nothing is certain in uncertain times
Hard to see beyond the greed and the crime
Oh, the faithful refuse to give up
Homeless and hungry survive just enough
Learn to smile through it all
They are blessed from above

Where miracles happen
Where truth can be heard

Yeah, that's where I am from
The city of hope

On the edge of the world, across oceans of blue
It's a place where a dream has a chance to come true
Do not be fooled by illusions, or falling from grace
Make your own destiny, find your own place
Where the streets speak the lessons of trouble, hope and pain

6 Feet under too late to save me, I'm not okay
One way trip to the grave will take me, I'm not okay
I’m not okay
I won’t let this take me

I know this place is fucked up darling
When it seems hard to live and so easy to die
These feelings won't go away
Tell me that I'm gonna be okay
I close my eyes and take a breath
Each one I take is one less left
Wasted youth, eternal debt
Terrified of what comes next
I'm sick of all the emptiness
Living dead amongst the rest
So tell me

Are we getting closer or lost again

[Intro]

[Couplet 1 : Léo]
Il y a des soirs comme ça où rien ne va
On se fait la gueule
Où tu te mets dans tous tes états
Car tu n'es pas la seule

J'ai fait le choix de rester fidèle
Fidèle à mon cœur, ah-ah
Ne me pose plus de questions sur elle
Car c'est toi la meilleure, de loin la meilleure

[Pré-refrain : Vickie]
Tu me fais mal
Et tu trouverais ça normal
Que je te dise que tout est ok
Fais c'qu'il te plaît

[Refrain : Vickie & Léo]
Tu peux compter sur moi
Même si je suis loin promis, je n't'oublie pas
Dans les virages, dans les rues mouillées, je pense à toi
Quand les nuages laissent place au plus beau jour qui soit
Promis, je n't'oublie pas

[Couplet 2 : Vickie & avec Léo]
J'ai même plus la force d'être consolée
Je veux tout arrêter
M'évaporer, me réincarner
Dans un autre espace temps et voir la vie différemment

Je regarde des photos d'avant
On faisait pas semblant, nan, nan
Je veux bien croire que tu m'aimes autant
Laisse-moi juste du temps

[Refrain : Vickie & Léo]
Tu peux compter sur moi
Même si je suis loin promis, je n't'oublie pas
Dans les virages, dans les rues mouillées, je pense à toi
Quand les nuages laissent place au plus beau jour qui soit
Promis, je n't'oublie pas

Tu peux compter sur moi
Je suis une branche et tu t'accroches à moi
Même si l'arbre penche surtout ne lâche pas
Me lâche pas
Bébé me lâche pas
Tu peux compter sur moi, ha-ha

Slowly grows
This crowd of beasts
A wild throng
With homemade wings

A golden rush
Of hopeful fiends
A giant heart
Set to redeem

We mounted steps
To take the sky
To rise above
Horizon lines

Across the plain
Came the brigade
The glowing line
A motorway

The zenith beamed
Into sight
The peak emitting
Blinding light

Reach above
Don't stay below
Let's look beyond
The flattened world

The world is round
The world is round
The world is round
The world is ours

Unto the clouds
We sent our truths
Metal birds
That volleyed through

The sky fatigued
Began to crack
And the rabble blasted
Through the gap

Inside the walls
We thundered hard
A rebel host
Defying stars

We clapped our hands
We raised the roof
And the rabble roused
Performed a coup

With vitriol
In the growling throats
We whirled our limbs
Like lightning bolts

A burst of noise
A searing flash
The fire roared
'til all was ash

This burning rock
A meteor
Its flying sparks
Spectacular!

Onwards!

Con trágicas dependidas
Dime que ya no me quieres
Para que no se me olvide

Llorando este adiós contigo
A tus amigos les cuentas
Alguna que otra mentira

Solo me resta decirte
Por ultima vez, te adoro
Que este amor que estas dejando
Vale lo que pesa el oro

Cambie de Santo pero aún soy el mismo demonio
Ni Carlos y José lograron aplacar mi odio
Y es obvio que aún escribo para incomodar
Figuras blasfemas Aunque no crea  en nada

He  vendido el alma varias veces
A crédito y por eso aún vivo de los intereses
El pasado no fue sencillo pero aún podía soñar
Ahora sólo las pesadillas vienen a visitar

Aún así acepto estoy mejor que nunca
Hasta deje de fantasear con el frío de la tumba
Solitario como un lince en la tundra
Ominoso cuál montaña que retumba

Quieren que hay en la tengo quieren títulos tengo
Les educo y entretengo pero sigo incompleto
Leí el libreto de mi vida y decidí hacerle cambios
El sancarleño cargado de diablos

Cada rima es un nuevo exorcismo
El qué termina no es el mismo que empezó la canción
En mi balanza oscila  el nihilismo
Contrapuesto ante la más Absurda ilusión

Lo que era turismo interno ahora es arqueología
Lo que fueran punchlines ahora es mitología
De esta rata que reniega del complejo de Mesías
No soy maestro ni guía mi única sabiduría

Es que se deja de mejorar cuando se acaba la vida
Mientras tanto todos y todas entrenando
Descubrí que escribo para hacer en mi el cambio
Que quiero en el mundo y no para jugar de profundo

Ni la fama pasajera y el lujo nauseabundo
Podrán cambiarme la mente para lograr
Que rime por otra cosa que no sea Buscar mi paz
Aunque he de admitir que algunas veces

El ego me controla el entorno me enfurece
Pierdo el camino me transformo en arrogante
Y debo de hacer un esfuerzo para volver a ser el de antes
Se agradece la paciencia pero no la indulgencia

Señal en mi si llego a abandonar la conciencia
Y recuerdenme que no tengo ninguna verdad
Tengo opiniones en canciones nada más
Si la rabia se agota me dedicaré a otra cosa

Viejo impresionista de pincelada pastosa
En un jardín japonés ver transcurrir Mi vejez
Entre fantasmas de todo lo que amé alguna vez
Sentir que la vida es hermosa y morir libre

Con un cartel en el pecho favor    revivirme
Cuando todo se acabe quiero volver para ver eso
Sin dejar descansar el  seso ni de ser obseso
Ni de diseccionar con torpe mano el universo

¿será que  seré por todavía pensarme?
Sin ojos para verme ni oídos para escucharme
¿será que alguna vez fui más que tinta y carne?

A false Universe set out for failure
Pulling the strings on your chosen saviour
Now it's just you and I...

Sold back to me in plastic packaging

Born in confusion
I spent my life suffering from illusions
If your creation wants something from me
Take my hand
See if you can drown me

You looked so beautiful, I never will forget
Then you opened up your eyes, looked at me and kinda smiled
I was scared, but still happy at the same time
I never wanted us to be a superficial family
But, in the end, it was the only thing we could be

Angie, I'm sorry I wasn't right for you
Just what did you expect for me to do?
You know that I would have done anything for you

I sometimes think about how things could be
If you would've took a chance and moved out here with me
We'd cruise along the 101 in the California sun
Sing Descendents songs and have ourselves lots of fun
Stay out drinking really late, stumble home from lower State

Long blonde hair lips you could eat
She thanked me for the drinks I bought
And said the train that she ought to have caught
Had probably left I heard a voice inside me
Say You lucky bugger
Break a leg
All my life I've tried to avert Incidents where, I could be hurt
At school they taught me right from wrong
No harm in being a weakling as long as long as you use your head
Yet on the stage if you want to succeed
The thing to do is break a leg
Why not an arm
Why Not a toe
Why only one when one as you know
Is not quite complete
To do that you need One more
Upon my word you take it from me
On my winter hols I love to ski
But rather than go down too fast
And end up with my face alas
Covered in egg I do as my instructor says
Get on that piste and break a leg
Why not an arm not a chin
What's so clever about breaking your leg so to speak how would your feet then grow
I went to do the other night
Could hardly drink cause I had to drive
And just as I was about to leave
A chap got up and spoke to me
Here's what he said I hear your leaving that's a shame
Its good to see you glad you came
Before you go from all of us here

What once was innocence, turned on its side
A cloud hangs over me, marks every move
Deep in the memory, of what once was love
Oh how I realised how I wanted time
Put into perspective, tried so hard to find
Just for one moment, thought I'd found my way
Destiny unfolded, I watched it slip away
Excessive flashpoints, beyond all reach
Solitary demands for all I'd like to keep
Let's take a ride out, see what we can find
A valueless collection of hopes and past desires
I never realised the lengths I'd have to go
All the darkest corners of a sense I didn't know
Just for one moment, I heard somebody call
Looked beyond the day in hand, there's nothing there at all
Now that I've realised how it's all gone wrong

Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway
Gotta find my destiny, before it gets too late

Get Into the Wind,Steppenwolf,"

Words and music by B. Cochran and C. Van Beek

Out on the highway, looking for a sign
That will lead me to the canyon
Got to meet some friends of mine
I can feel the fires burnin'
As I ride into the light
Got to keep the wheels turnin'
If I have to ride all night

Cause time is a wastin'
They got wine for the tastin'
Woh...Don't you know
Got to get into the wind

I can hear the whistle blowin'
As I'm comin' to the track
Got to get to where I'm goin'
Cause you know I can't go back
There is somethin' deep inside me
I can feel the chilly night
My body's tired and restless
But, Lord, I've got to fight

When I get to where I'm goin'
I know just what I'll find
The fires will be glowin'
So I've got to make some time
Ain't nothin' gonna stop me
Though it's gettin' mighty cool
I've got to keep on goin'
Cause the canyon is my home

Hold my future in her hands but

We'll book this tour it will be oh oh oh so good
We're gonna steal your guarantee ... shit!
Oh steer clear, we're on a wicked path
We've got plans, wicked plans

It's the least we can do
'Cause we've got to get ours somehow
It would be too easy making ten percent off the tours we book for you
So we figure we'll take as much as we can cause it's not up to you
The music the bands provide brings the kids to the show, so you know we just don't care
There are a lot of other bands we can use if you don't want this tour
The point is
Is even though everyone knows
We treat the bands like shit
And nobody has the guts to speak out
'Cause they're afraid that they won't get the tours at the end of the day

You fucking kids have got to learn the golden rules
You gotta use who you can on the way to the middle
You only give a favor for a favor in return
You get burned if you turn the other cheek

We don't believe you kids are so naive
To think that things could change
'Cause nothing ever changes in the real world
We're going to drive that message home
'Cause money fills the gas tank in the van

Oh steer clear we're on a wicked path

Annan Waters,Kate Rusby,"

Oh, Annan Water's wondrous deep
And my love Ann is wondrous bonny
I'm loathe that she should wet her feet
Because I lover her best of any
Go saddle for me the bonny grey mare
Go saddle her and make her ready
For I must cross the stream tonight
Or never more I'll see my lady

He's ridden over field and fen
O'er moor and moss and many's the mire
But the spurs of steel were sore to bite
Sparks from the mare's hoofs flew like fire
The mare flew over moor and moss
And when she reached the Annan Water
She couldn't have ridden a furlong more
Had a thousand whips been laid upon her

And woe betide you Annan Waters
By night you are a gloomy river
And over you I'll build a bridge
That never more true love can sever

""Oh Boatman put off your boat
Put off your boat for gold and money
For I must cross the stream tonight
Or never more I'll see my lady.""
""Oh the sides are steep, the waters deep
From bank to brae the water's pouring
And the bonny grey mare she sweats for fear
She stands to hear the water roaring.""

And he has tried to swim the stream
And he swam on both strong and steady
But the river was deep and strength did fail
And never more he'll see his lady
Oh woe betide the willow wand
And woe betide the bush and briar
For you broke beneath my true love's hand
When strength did fail and limbs did tire

And woe betide you Annan Water
By night you are a gloomy river
And over you I'll build a bridge

That never more true love can sever
That never more true love can sever

I Stand,Idina Menzel,"

When you ask me, who I am…
What is my vision? And do I have a plan?
Where is my strength? Have I nothing to say?
I hear the words in my head, but I push them away

I live for the perfect day
I love till it hurts like crazy
I hope for a hero to save me
I stand for the strange and lonely
I believe there's a better place
I don't know if the sky is heaven
But I pray anyway

And I don't know
What tomorrow brings
The road less traveled
Will it set us free?
Cause we are taking it slow
These tiny legacies
I don't try and change the world;
But what will you make of me?

I hope for a hero to save me

We fall just like leaves
As the rain washes us from the ground

I can show you better than I say it

Young nigga, I remember
Ain't no stopping it, a hell nah
I got bills I'm obligated to, and you know
It's still that struggle rap shit everyday, ain't shit changed
But one thing that I refuse to do is maintain
I you know anything you want it life can be obtained
Know that there ain't no such thing as living twice, so get it while you can
Niggas thought it really wasn't what it was though
Til' you realize it's all in your brain
Now I got everybody hollering out Chaz French
But these things take time and it's so strange (so strange)
I remember back in the day
When Matt Reed was packing a K
And we had no where else to stay
Lived in a hotel for 30 a day
Had no way to pay
Spent everything we had on Newports and drinks
Mollys and weed
Lifestyle consisted of drugs and dreams
And no where to sleep or eat
But young nigga...

I remember
How can I forget?
When I was miles and miles away
Young Nigga,  I remember
How can I forget?
All Mama had for me was love and a prayer
Young nigga, I remember
How can I forget?
When shawty telling me that she'll always be there
I don't think that she remembers
But she damn sure can't forget
Well either way it go. I'm going to always forgive her

[Verse 2: Chaz French]
Just make sure that you remeber...
That everything ain't what it seems
And good times don't last forever
But could last for a lifetime
Let's make memories
And remember to strive off good energy
And always recognize fake-nigga tendencies
Put nothing before god and the family
Middle finger to mediocracy
Let's stay true to your legacy, cuh'-cuh'...
I remember back in the day
When I got jumped when I lived in the Trey
You know jealousy get the best of niggas
When they barely know you but still feeling a way
On to the next, I got pictures to paint
Might fly out my ex's to show them my place
When you get change you gon' see how they change
Just make sure you never forget where you came!

Young nigga, I remember
How can I forget? (Hay!)
When we was down and out for days
Young Nigga,  I remember
How can I forget?
I said the struggle gon' always make us

You should've been the one to die

You call it tough love, but love shouldn't burn
Did everything ya could to make the hurting worse
Now everyone knows the kind of man ya are
So ya spend your days drowning yourself at the bar

Took abuse to another level
Made her think that she was talking to the Devil
One day you'll get hit where it hurts
You're the next one in line to feel the burn

Light up another cigarette
Pray to God you forget
The screams that she made
As your fist landed on her face

You wanted this, you told her to
Painted body black and blue
Wrong place, wrong time, just her luck
You know what you did so get fucked

How many cuts because of you?
So you cover them with a bruise
Ruin a life like you did it for fun
Angry gets shit done

I said get fucked

It's like casting a curse
You loved making the hurting worse
Your biggest regret since the birth
Now she isn't on the Earth

I scream to God on my knees
I wish I was the one to bleed
An eye for an eye
Why did she have to die?

Empathy,Traitors,"

I can't hear you anymore.
I don't need to, I don't have to,
I don't wanna listen anymore.
I've swung too far from ego to apathy.

I used to be empathetic,
Every decision is becoming hectic.
Everybody was pulling me under,
It's beginning to make me wonder.

Why do I feel like I'm arguing with myself?
Is it me, is it everybody else?
I'm so concerned about you, so much dwelling with all of this.
I've made myself so sick of all of it.

So sick of all of it.
So sick of all of it.
Common sense nonexistent.
So sick of all it.

Don't push me, cause I'm close to the edge.
I'm trying not to lose my head.
Sometimes sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under.

I am,
I am no longer empathetic.
I have realized it's feeble and pathetic.

You try so hard in this old fashioned game
You can't lose cause there aren't that any rules

I understand, cause you make it true
You can't loose when you know what to choose

It is easy to feel small
So damn easy to feel no good at all

You mended my heart and you put back the part that was missing
Cause you are true

Quan Surt el Sol,Brams (Català),"

Sec sota el porxo vell
A aixopluc de l'aiguat que cau
I a la terra el tempir fa bona olor

Veig que un tros més enllà
Un veí treu el cap
S'ho mira, somriu i em veu i ens saludem

Plou per tot arreu
Sens distingir quin camp és de qui

Sembla que està a punt d'afluixar
I la natura la feina atura
I l'ocellam desvetlla el camp
I certifica que el cel s'estripa

Quan surt el sol, surt per tothom
Sense preguntes ni privilegis
Així de natural és
La societat que pretenem

Nits a la llar de foc
Explicant contes als menuts
Que havíem sentit a l'avi allà mateix

Ve el veí a fer el cafè
I diu que es veu que hi ha nous veïns
D'una terra llunyana que ara és un erm

El vent de migjorn
Que va fer ahir els ha dut fins aquí

A l'endemà els anirem a donar
La benvinguda, i si cal ajuda
Per fer a poc a poc una llar de foc
On contar rondalles a la canalla
Sec sota el porxo vell
A aixopluc de l'aiguat que cau
Aquesta terra és nostra però el món és de tots

Through this smoke rise through the city heat

So we got a Mustang
That pony broke down and it started to smoke
So we took off running down a desert road

Baby we're not lost, we're just looking around
Floating like dreams in a bottle on the sea
They go and they go just like a you and me

Whoa roll it down, let the wind blow
Throwing maps out the window

With the song in hearts
And some cash in our hand
Guess we made god laugh
When we told him our plan
Who ever knew it'd be this much fun
Following fate straight into the sun

Never Gonna Leave You,Us The Duo,"

[Verse 1]
There's a million other guys who would leave ya
And when you say that you're in love, they won't believe ya
When you're gone and outta town, they'll deceive ya
Girl, you must examine how they treat ya

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the kinda guy who wants to show you why
Love can conquer all
Don't be worried, don't be scared
Just know that I'll be there

I'm never gonna leave you
I'm never gonna break your heart again
I'm never gonna leave you
Searching far and wide for your loving man
You don't have to look far, you don't have to look around
My love's inside of you and that heart that pounds
I'm never gonna leave, never gonna leave
You, you, you, you

There's a million other guys who would date ya
Just to turn around and replace ya
And in their double life, they never educate ya
'Cause down in their heart, they're just a player

And makes the loudest noise I've ever seen

Again and Again,Bob Mould,"

It began sometime last week
The feeling that most everything was changing for the worse
All the triggers pulled at once
So begins my ugly fall from grace - again

I made myself delusional, the noble stab at staying upbeat
It was only for a while
Tried my best to radiate through hurricanes and double eights
The pair split into two

Talking points from up on high
Watch me walk the ledge, I am comfortable out here by myself
You could never reach me here
Words distroted in the wind, landing softly there beneath the trees

Our trip to California, don't say I didn't try to warn you
Put down the cell phone, and try to be with me
Did you see me disappear like vapor rolling through the hills
And then, the silence of your name

I never found the trust I needed from you
Everything you did was making me wonder
My biggest mistake was taking you back
Again and again

Couldn't forgive the things that you did
I'm glad it worked out for you, but
You're only fooling yourself if you think you won't do it
Again and again

Sad attempts at poetry, sad attempts at happiness
The sadness of reality
I'm OK, I've been OK, I'll stay OK

I took the bullets from the carport, toossed them in my backpack
Placed a set of keys inside the grill
I left the title to the house inside the piano bench
And my lawyer's got the will

When you got no more assurance
Than a great big hunk o' lead
If you don't respond to romance
Jack, you're dead

When a chick is smilin' at you
Even though there's nothin' said
If you stand there like a statue
Jack, you're dead

But you stubbed your toes
When you ups and kicks the bucket
Just like ol' man Mose'

When you get no kicks from lovin'
And you blow your top instead
It's a fact that you ain't livin'
Jack, you're dead

When you just ain't got nobody
Since you gone and lost your head
Rigor mortis has set in, daddy
Jack, you're dead

What's the use of havin' muscles
When your life hangs by a thread
If you ain't got no red corpuscles
Jack, you're dead

If you can't get with 'em
When the band comes on
If you just ain't got no rhythm
Man you're really gone

You can't go any further
And the news begins to spread
All the cats will holler ""murder""

And I'm so glad
What you glad about
It's a beautiful day man (sure is)
Sun shining (hell yeah)
It's all nice all the folks out
Cooling man (just chilling)
Everything's going good

And I'm so glad we made it this far
I know my world won't be the same without y'all

To all my friends how ya'll been
It's been some time now I'm back again
New places to go more people to see
Just living and working on the new LP
And if you happen to float by and we ain't home
Hopefully means the CE hit the road
With a vision and a sense of awareness
It's like we spent a lifetime preparing for this
And it's got to be true
All that I do I'm willing to be
And I'm just like you fulfilling my dream
And in the meantime I try to talk some
So I can chalk one
A win for the team
See my destiny instantly cling
Never let them be clipping my wings
I need to spread them things
Meant to be seen and witness what's in between
I'm just being me trust and believe
That in your life you may see
What they say is right just may not be
Look to be yourself and you might learn
That you're gonna need more than some time to burn
Got to find your heart develop a skill
Study the art fill your head up with real facts
And figures and listen to different outlooks
It's really less about pull more about push
Wishing is one thing living it is another
Given an inspiration this is what you will discover
A whole world wide open waiting for you
And no matter what you'll be making it through
Cause you understand the pressure
Know when to draw the line
Come prepared lessons
Never fall behind
It's a sign of the times a new time is coming
I'm gonna keep doing mine in due time abundance


And I'm so glad we made it this far
I know my world won't be the same without y'all

Now bloods thicker than the liquor that I'm sipping on
More to living than the rhythm that I'm spitting on
I recollect for a second and us regulars do
Give respect to the rest of my crew
2002 to what it is
We be handling biz
From overseas trying to sell CD's to all my kids
Just a page in the book in my life
And still writing in the game and I'm rolling the dice
But still fighting for the feelings
Dealing with the highs and lows
The 2500's and the 25 shows
But fam grows the fans show love in the process
Palm slaps and daps tend to follow the live sets
And that's the object I'm pushing the project
Priceless without it you tend to be lifeless
I might just cool and remember the rules
Remain true can't forget to let the night shine through
And keep moving ya'll
Keep moving ya'll


So far....
Keep moving ya'll

Wait
Did I forget to give you a little bit
More
You can sit close or get in the thick of it
Young
Intimate would have been in the lyrics
A sentimental spirit wish ya'll were here with me
Then again I'm a loner and need space
Trying to find a moment to create in this rat race
Rush rush move move keep running
Just hush hear the soothing sound of nothing
Wind blowing in my ear
Fear no one let momma nature take me there
Wait right here let me get my things I'll be back
Face full of tracks with paint for days in the pass
Trying to bless in every way while I have an opportunity
To drop it musically I got to do it and be true to me
I got a crew and a community we're soon to see a
New beginning bloom beautifully


And I'm so glad we made it this far
I know my world won't be the same without y'all

For none can stand the power of Almighty God

Prism Of Life,Enigma,"

I am hunted by the future
Will the future be my past?
Or is time a fade out picture
Of my everlasting cast?
Love is phasing, love is moving
To the rhythm of your sight
I get closer
To the crossing point of light

Pleni sunt cæli et terra gloria tua

Let us try to live our lost illusions
They're the Sun at night
If we don't, we'll never taste
The spice of life
And when it seems that we're in a dead end street
There's no reason to cry
'Cause we have a helping hand who's always aside
Forever light

Is daar bitter min genade
Dis waarom ons glo, dis waarom ons bid
Want wat kan groter wees

Wat maak dat ek my land verweer
Die nag oor Afrika will keer?
Want swart bly altyd swart
En wit bly wit -
So marsjeer ons in gelid

En beskryf die paradys
Wat uit die chaos sal verrys

Daarom word hy meer paraat
Dra hy 'n wapen selfs op straat
Teen die bose oormag van die swart gevaar (2x)

Welcome to the search for meaning
If you’re alive, then you’re feeling
What it is to be happy, lonely, broken
To be human
We’re all the same when it all comes down to it
All looking for hope when we’re going through it
At the end of the day it’s not far away
Hope is anywhere, any place we are
There’s nothing you need to fear
Because His love is reminding us
Hope is right here, hope is right here
Hope is here
You are not alone in the moments
When you’re afraid
He holds them in His hands
So you can rest in the promise
This world may not be home
But that don’t mean we’re on our own
Because His love is reminding us
Hope is right here, hope is right here
This world may not be home
But that don’t mean we’re on our own
Because His love is alive in us
Hope is right here, hope is right here

Expose it, mind turned outwards
Poured through my dirty fingers
Sharing pain and bliss, my ocean
I take my art offensive
We're all alone
Broken hearted and insane
Nowhere to go

Strangle my voice and you have it
A gray oppression
Wrap my eyes and you have it
A mind control
So sick of hiding in and out of narrow lines
I'm choking
Call me abrasive itÀs all I know

Insatiable, born with a taste
That set our frozen lips to fire
Doomed to feel with such intensity

How a Cowgirl Says Goodbye - 2007 Remaster,Tracy Lawrence,"

A cup of coffee with the first sunlight
At a last chance Texaco
I'm thumbin' through a worn out road map
Tryin' to decide which way to go
These empty miles and her memory
They just seem to linger on
She left me on this lost highway
Wonderin' why and where she's gone

That's how a cowgirl breaks a young man's heart
That's how my whole world slowly came apart
With a cold and empty stare
As if I wasn't there
She didn't even stop to cry
That's how a cowgirl says goodbye

Called up her mama in Abilene
Just to find out how she'd been
She said she'd stopped awhile in San Antone
To spend some time with an old friend
With all this distance in between us
I'm sure I never cross her mind
And it may take all these roads ahead
Just to leave it all behind

That's how a cowgirl breaks a young man's heart
That's how my whole world slowly came apart
With a cold and empty stare
As if I wasn't there
Didn't even stop to cry
That's how a cowgirl says goodbye

That's how a cowgirl breaks a young man's heart
That's how my whole world slowly came apart
With a cold and empty stare
As if I wasn't there
She didn't even stop to cry
I guess that's how a cowgirl says goodbye

Feel no remorse
No sense of shame

Turn your code into law
Compensate to validate the loss
Take a thief
Nail him to a cross

Deviate from the absolute
Born of revenge
Raised on cement

Through the forests and mountains green
To the cabin we shared. By the wild running river

Singing my song to you
And all through my days, Ill remember you always
I never knew love so true
It's a tangled old past through the thick byers and brambles
Down to where the wild roses bloom
And open their hearts in the heat of the summer
And freeze beneath the silver moon
I live my life on the banks of the water
Singing my song to you
And all through my days Ill remember you remember you always
I never knew love like you
Its a tumbling run down the bear creek canon
Through the rocks and the mountain sage
Its a trembling stream in the frozen winter
Running strong when the spring waters break

Singing my songs to you
And all through my days Ill remember you always

Then let us fight without fear
And the fighting has commence

Dir die Welt, wir trinken Kaffee auf Hawaii
Mach dich bereit für deine beste Zeit
Die ganzen schlechten Tage sind gezählt und längst vorbei
Hol' dir die Sterne aus dem All
Bin bei dir ganz ich selbst und gerne durchgeknallt
Baby, du gewährst mir Einblick
In dein Leben, zweifel nie an dir, denn ein Blick reicht
Und ich merk', ich bin der Schönste für dich
Doch deine Freundinnen, sie mögen mich nicht, aber ist mir egal

[Bridge]
Alle Männer wollen wie ich sein
Aber keiner dieser Männer kann wie ich sein, nein, nein
Denn ich hab' die Schönste der Frau'n
Doch ihre Freundinnen, sie mögen mich kaum, aber ist mir egal

Auch wenn ich schweig', du weißt Bescheid (Baby, Baby, Baby)
Auch wenn ich schweig', du weißt Bescheid (Baby, Baby, Baby)

[Part 2]
Yeah, ich kann wirklich keinem vertrau'n
Aber dir vertrau' ich, dir vertrau' ich, Baby (Baby)
Ja, manchmal streiten wir beide
Und öfter dreh'n wir uns im Kreis
Doch, Baby, dann geb' ich's dir mehr als fünf Minuten
Ich mach's dir gern' so oft wie du's willst
Denn du bist meine Frau
Und noch schärfer als die aktuelle Lady aus dem Weißen Haus
Baby, du gewährst mir Einblick
In dein Leben, zweifel nie an dir, denn ein Blick reicht
Und ich merk', ich bin der Schönste für dich
Doch deine Freundinnen, sie mögen mich nicht, aber ist mir egal

I Took Your Picture Off the Wall,Luke Wilmoth,"

Constellations are the frame
For the image that you've always dreamed of taking
We were riding out the waves
Hoping we might become something in the making

I've seen lovers as they leave their halves unfaithful
I've seen liars as they prove themselves ungrateful
Though we never were a violent fit like these became
The feeling is equivocally the same

I couldn't handle second best
But your number was the one that I could call
To fight the overwhelming stress
I took your picture off the wall

Decisions are a game
Of creating something that is worth the taking
I have absorbed the blame
For creating that of which has led to breaking

Where do you think you're going now?

I couldn't handle second best
But your number was the one that I could call
To fight the overwhelming stress
I took your picture off the wall

July I went and headed west
But I was home again by fall
To clean this overwhelming mess
I took your picture off the wall
Whoa, whoa
To fight the overwhelming stress
I took your picture off the wall

I couldn't handle second best
But your number was the one that I could call
To fight the overwhelming stress
I took your picture off the wall

July I went and headed west
But I was home again by fall
To clean this overwhelming mess
I took your picture off the wall
Whoa, whoa
To fight the overwhelming stress
I took your picture off the wall

[Lyrics/Letra ""Stay Awake"" ft. KeykeTheGirl; Radamiz]

[Intro: KeykeTheGirl]

[Verso 1: Cres]
Se les está olvidando enseñarnos a ser felices
Míralos tan pequeños y con tantas cicatrices
Estamos deshumanizados
Ni valores, ni educación, ni moral
Normal que sigamos cayendo en picado
Nos han atravesado con mentiras
Esta vida es puta y tienes que pagarle
Y a veces te folla hasta arruinarte
Por eso en ocasiones vivo en la ignorancia
Siempre cuido el arte genuino, extravagante
Quiero dejarte algo que te aporte y que te inspira ganas de vivir
No hay nada malo en insistir
Que si una puerta no se abre, se abre otra
Mis discos son mis hijos, es como cuido mi obra
¿Y si no se va a más?
Claro que se va a ir a más, ya verás cuando mires atrás
Y te des cuenta que ese infierno
Por el que pasaste mereció la pena
Sólo crecer como persona ya me llena

Hay un camino fácil pa' llegar
Hay piedras, pero hay que echar a andar
Algunos se resisten y hay que estar despierto
Los palos llegan sin avisar, oh lord
This life will give you but it was striped away
That's why we trying to stay awake

Heart of Twilight - Remastered,Edguy,"

Tell me why can't I understand
The feelings deep inside
Why do I try to scratch away the stains
Deep in my heart I feel there's a place
Where love and hate collide
But is everybody who asks for reasons
Destined to go insane

I don't know if I'm right or wrong
The heart of twilight is much too strong
Leaving the pride so I'm stopping to stride
I only dare to hide

Dying, dying! My mind is what I've lost
My head is dying cold
Dying, dying! My mind is what I've lost
The heart of twilight knows

An old illusion of understanding
Is fading day by day
The apparition of a future vision is black
Everytime I dive in depressions
The colors of life are grey
Father forgive me if I decide to come back

That's How I'll Remember You,David Nail,"

Wakin' up in the sand, sunburn on your nose
You scream and squeezed my hand
When your east Kentucky toes hit the Atlantic
Summertime in Brooklyn, Mustard on your lip
I knew I loved you by the bottom of the fifth
I never planned it

A million perfect moments go rushin' through my brain
Our first trip to the ocean, your first time on a plane
When you look over your shoulder, baby, you can choose
To remember me however you want to
That's how I'll remember you

The dress that you were wearin', soakin' up the stains
I can still see your mascara, though I can't recall the pain
Of what came after
You were even beautiful tellin' me goodbye
Maybe my version of the truth is just a lie
What Does It Matter?
What Does It Matter?

A million perfect moments go rushin' through my brain
Every time I smell October you're standing in the rain
When you look over your shoulder, baby, you can choose
To Remember me however you want to
That's how I'll remember you

I've forgot the bitter, the winter's just a blur
I savor the sweet as if the summer's all we were
And ever will be, oh, and I still see

A million perfect moments go rushin' through my brain
Every time I touch the ocean, anytime I taste the rain
When you look over your shoulder, baby, you can choose
To remember me however you want to
That's how I'll remember you

That's how I'll remember you

I awoke from a dream today
Man it seemed so real
Close my eyes and try to drift away
But memories keep haunting me

A thorn in my side, a chip on my shoulder
A lump in my throat, the size of a boulder
The chill up my spine, can't get any colder
And you wonder why i can't smile

A knot in my gut, an ape on my back
In the heat of the moment
I'm knocked off the track
You drop the ball, i pick up the slack
And you ask me why my hair's gray

I say it's green and then you tell me it's red
Keep your thoughts and ideas
Locked inside of your head
We've got someone
Who can think for you instead
And he sounds just like the last one

Twisting, turning
Losing all sense of yearning
Living and learning
The pressure keeps on burning my soul
(burning my soul)

Burning my soul
(burning my soul)
(soul)
Burning my soul

Responsible thinkers
Throw caution to the wind
But i find myself
Speaking from within
I can't live my life
Walking on eggshells
To stay on your good side

Using your words
Controlling my life
Can't you see it's my words
That gives you your life
So i hurt your feelings
Well i'm really sorry
But i don't give a shit, no...

Third time, been caught twice
Forgive our neighbor Bob, I think he humped the dog

Io amo la periferia
Da quando ho incontrato te
Mi piace aspettare la sera
Seguendo le strade
Che portan lontano dalla città

Le case in periferia
Risuonan di grida e di canzoni
E mille mille panni colorati
Si muovono al vento
Bandiere di festa solo per noi

Passan le ore ad una ad una
E non mi stanco di aspettarti
Ma se solo ritardi di un minuto
Io non vivo più

Poi quando in periferia
Si accendono le prime luci
Tu vieni e nell’ombra mi baci
Dimentico il mondo
Ritorno bambino

(Che:)
In June of forty-three there was a military coup
Behind it was a gang called the G.O.U
Who did not feel the need to be elected

They had themselves a party at the point of a gun
They were slightly to the right of Attila the Hun
A bomb or two and very few objected

Yeah, just one shell and governments fall like flies, kapow, die
They stumble and fall, bye bye
Backs to the wall, aim high
We're having a ball
The tank and bullet rule as democracy dies

The lady's got potential, she was setting her sights
On making it in movies with her name in lights
The greatest social climber since Cinderella

OK, she couldn't act but she had the right friends
And we all know a career depends
On knowing the right fella to be stellar

Yeah, just one shell and governments lose their nerve, kapow, die
They stumble and fall, bye bye
Backs to the wall, aim high
We're having a ball
That's how we get the government we deserve

Now the man behind the President calling the shots
Involved so discreetly in a lot of their plots
Was Colonel Juan Peron, would be dictator

He began in the army out in Italy so
Saw Mussolini's rise from the very front row
I reckon he'd do likewise sooner or later

Yeah, just one blast and the tear gas falls like rain, kapow, die
They haven't a chance, bye bye
The terrorists advance
But one guy doesn't dirty his hands
Peron was biding time out in the slow lane

Yeah, suddenly an earthquake hit the town of San Juan, kapow, die
They stumble and fall, bye bye
Keep away from the wall
But one guy was having a ball
The tragedy, a golden chance for Peron

He organized a concert with incredible flair
In aid of all the victims, such a grand affair
Politicians, actors, stars of every flavor

It was January twenty-second, 1944
A night to remember, yeah, that's for sure
For that's the night that Peron first met Eva

We let the vultures in, to pick the bones of this affair
A thousand years from now, we'll lick our wounds and say goodbye
So long, euphoria, we set the table with sharp knives

We seem to be wasting away now, dust covers the traces we left
Still I feel safer around you, when we feed on each others fear

Colorful,The Verve Pipe,"

The show is over - close the storybook
There will be no encore
And all the random hands that i have shook
Well, they're reaching for the door
I watch the backs as they leave single-file
You stood stubborn, cheering all the while

I know i can be colorful
I know i can be grey
I know this loser's living fortunate
Cause i know you will love me either way

Most were being good for goodness sake
But you wouldn't pantomine
You are more beautiful when you awake
Than most are in a lifetime
Through the haze that is my memory
You stayed for drama though you paid for a comedy

I know i can be colorful
I know i can be grey
I know this loser's living fortunate
Cause i know you will love me either way

Look ahead as far as you can see
We live in drama but we'll die in a comedy

I know i can be colorful (when you live in black and white)
I know i can be grey (my colors fade away)
I know this loser's living fortunate
Cause i know you will love me either way

I know i can be colorful (when you live in black and white)
I know i can be grey (my colors fade away)
I know this loser's living fortunate
And i know you will love me
Yes i know you will love me
I know you will love me either way

La prima volta,Koly,"

KOLY:
La mia droga si chiama Julie
È più fresca dell erba che ho in tasca
Viene da Marseille o Paris
L'ho conosciuta in un coffee di Praga

Sto sempre fatto come Di Caprio
In Basketball Diaries
Il destino è beffardo e fa il bastardo
Finché non cambi

Quello che voglio lo prendo
Un giorno ci arriverò
In fiamme sono Ghost Rider
Per dare tutto anche ai miei bro

Scrittori come George Orwell
Cavalco un sogno Tom Sawyer
La mattina mi sveglio col sole
Che mi consola in poche parole

Sono a circa 1000° Fahrenheit
Sono in gabbia Faraday
Vogliono vedere solo il meglio che farai
Ad alcuni manco importa se ce la farai

Sai di notte ho le visioni
Tra l'ansia le indecisioni
Ti chiamano e non rispondi
Questo sentirsi speciali darà vita ai sogni

È tutto come la mia prima volta
È tutto come la mia prima volta
Giuro che va tutto bene
Giuro che va tutto bene
Bene bene bene

DENKO:
Mi hanno che non sono nessuno
Forse un tizio (qualcuno)
Mi hanno detto fra sei solo illuso
Possono baciarmi il culo

Fosse solo un vizio ne sarei immune
Fossi io il tizio resterei muto
Basterebbe solo un po' d'acume
Già da come parli, la mano prude

Non è la prima volta che ti infili nei miei cazzi
Tanto che fai pensare che vai in giro a cercarli
Rivedendo i miei passi, risalite e collassi
Mai preso una sberla in più di quante ne meritassi, tu meno

Si vede dal rispetto che porti, ti prego
Non ce la dai bere, non sei un serio
Qui ci vediamo lungo (No, sul serio)
Sì ci vediamo in limbo, bianco o nero

Riparto dallo zero al cento
E non è la prima nè l'ultima volta
Denko shapeshifter non mi becchi in pieno
Sempre in cerca della buona svolta

Pugni in pancia McGregor
Come da bambini con la prima cotta
Il sette è dove mi alleno
Mi trovi anche sta volta a saltare la corda
Sì che salto la corda

KOLY:
È tutto come la mia prima volta
È tutto come la mia prima volta
Giuro che va tutto bene
Giuro che va tutto bene

Aonde foi parar aquela menina
Que me encantava quase toda noite
Jogando ao vento,palavras olhares
Sorrisos e pernas
Telefonemas de duplo sentido
Que me deixaram de calo no ouvido
E aquele jeito assim de respirar
A fim de me afogar de paixão e desejo

Fiz o possível pra não dar bandeira
Até pensei que não era comigo
Mas você foi mais e mais se achegando e apertando o cerco
Usando todas as armas que sabe usar uma mulher quando quer
Pois então vem complete agora o teu feitiço
Vem, não faz essa cara de quem não tem nada com isso
Vem, para com esse papo de o que é que eu fiz
Faça o que quiser eu me rendo

The One Who Got Away,Honey,"

Honey:
Came my way , played a part
Paved a way through my heart when you washed away like a wave
That vision in my brain to this day
I think about the shit you used to say
Outta sight, out your mind but I didn’t hate.  However did admire with amaze
Your mind a race, and mine a maze
Hind site, probably wasn’t good taste
Though, not a waste, you were my baby
Could write  a song bout the way you changed
Love is cravy, romance wavy
You were the sun
And we were hella young, hella sprung
And now I’ve lost and I’ve loved
And I guess it really was cus it really stung
Yeah I miss you like the moon miss the sun
Or a mother miss her only son
Where gone are the days?
Reunited souls are one,we could’ve won
But now it’s done

Hook:
Pretty hard for my consious not to sway, at least every other day
You could say time replays
Feelings  now gray
But on brings  brighter days


Verse 2:
I wanna know why the road turns
Tell me why the pretty smiles always getting burned, never earned
I’m concerned. Heartbreak 101
Lesson learned
Bridges burned in a turn of events unexpected
On the fence lacked common sense
In a sense
In his defense he was sorta dense
Tho at my expense made it pretty tense
Never planned to commence
I shoulda sensed
Not every heart wins
Not every soul is kin
Not every end is wrong
Not every hand you hold  is strong
Or a tight one
Or more often the right one
Go head light one
As I shed this light once
Sound like a dunce to deaf ears
I wrote this one for my peers through the years, I had to volunteer
Shout-out my engineer
You got me half way here

Yours truly
The one who got away

And my heart still aches

That's how she was, so young and free

A kind of love cash can't afford
I wanted to believe
She's got the voice of harmony
And the mind of Socrates
When we meet, it's in a Jeep
It's only you and me
While we sleep on scared grounds
We talk about this love we found
I feel the Earth and it's spinning round
Now we both believe
She's so young, yet so old

With the fairy tale
She's so young, yet so old

Can you see what you've done?
What a mess you've made
Your carelessness and disregard for everyone you love
And those who loved you back
We have to cope with constant pressure

Will you be here another day?
We want you back
Another day passed is another day lost
Get back on track

Don't let yourself go, don't ever lose sight of us
Because if you do, it will be the end of everything we thought was real

You walk a thin line
You walk the tightest rope
Suspended high above a sea of empty hopes

We will be waiting on the other side
It's up to you now, to make everything all right

Never Like You,Magica,"

All of my life I've felt so different
I walked the simple way
All I expect is that you keep your promise
And honor what you say

We reach a little higher
We search a world without deception
Our hearts are set on fire
To change your misconception

I will never deny who I am nor sell my belief
I will never hide in the dark like a thief
I will never stab from behind nor run from a fight
We will never surrender because
We'll be never like you

I will never do the work of a liar
I will never turn, never like you
I will never do like you desire
We are not the same, never like you

I am so tired of short time solutions
Reversed psychologies
Your false beliefs start revolutions
No more apologies!

We reach a little higher
We search a world without deception
Our hearts are set on fire
To change your misconception

I will never deny who I am nor sell my belief
I will never hide in the dark like a thief
I will never stab from behind nor run from a fight
We will never surrender because
We'll be never like you

I will never do the work of a liar
I will never turn, never like you
I will never do like you desire
We are not the same, never like you

I cannot stand being lied in my face
We've paid the toll
You cannot make a fool of me it's not the case
Let us roll

I will never deny who I am nor sell my belief
I will never hide in the dark like a thief
I will never stab from behind nor run from a fight
We will never surrender because
We'll be never like you

I will never do the work of a liar
I will never turn, never like you
I will never do like you desire
We are not the same, never like you

Oooh oh yea
It's been so long since I've seen your face
So long since I've been to first base
*strike 3 you're out*
I really miss the feel of your kiss
But can I have back my things before
I get really pissed?
You had my heart, my soul, my attention
But you walked out my life with my CD collection

Breaking up is hard enough (oh oh oh oh)

Or do I have to involve the police

There was a time when I'd trust you alone
I'd call you up girl, but you took my phone
You borrow stuff every time I turn my back
*hey, that's mine!*

Lady MacBeth & Miss Havisham,Hiccup,"

[Verse 1]
I took the long way down
I went the wrong way 'round
Stood contemplating my contingency
I broke that thing in two
Lost what I meant to do
Stuck shaking hands with electricity

[Pre-Chorus]
By the time you found me I had nearly fallen through the hole in my head
I was choking, you were joking, I was laughing, I was breathing instead
Only life can bring you back from the dead

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 2]
I wandered down the halls
Like a confused pinball
Lady Macbeth meets Mrs. Havisham
The kid I used to be
Wrote in a diary
Lulled off to sleep with just a ceiling fan

[Pre-Chorus]
If you catch me rollin' 'round under the moonlight cracking my head
I am never so untethered I don’t feel you tugging back on my thread
So just tell me, baby, go back to bed
Go back to bed

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 3]
I broke that thing in two
Lost what I meant to do
And it all spun perpetually
But we played through the set
And I pressed the last fret
And we promptly ran into the sea
I forgot how to sleep
I drank too much caffeine
When I lay there it felt like the end
With your hand on my head
You said go back to bed
Oh, these things keep me hangin' by a golden thread

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

Ask me where I come from, I'll say a different land
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

I count gates and numbers, then play the guessing game
It's just the place that changes, the rest is still the same
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

Still Everything,Ettison Clio,"

Falling back to where we start again
Disturbing shift to something less than desired
And are you glad to have me off your shoulder?
Relieved i was so easy to get over
Maybe you haven't finished yet
Yet are words this fragile?
They deflate at the first sign of fear
Your world disassembled
But you won't give me a chance to help you heal
We don't deserve
You should move on
Advice through phone lines stinging strong
But i could never despise a face i adore
I'll hide behind these sunken eyes
Pretend i don't care you've denied
Remember: i was everything you ever wanted
Oh everything you wanted
And now i'm falling back to where we start again
Disturbing shift to something less than desired
And are you glad to have me off your shoulder?
Relieved i was so easy to get over
I haven't finished yet
Yet i close my eyes
I can't seem to forget
I'm back there with you
I'm lying in your bed
The slightest stir provokes your lips to move to mine
And i'm listening as you hold your breath
Reveling in the thought of you beside me
Why did this change?
What happens now?
Forced to build up wall i let down
But you still find a way to charm me somehow
My head spins as if abused
Unanswered question leave me confused
But you're still everything i've ever wanted
You're still everything
You're still my everything

I was on a path to the limelight
Now I'm on another one it's a night flight
When they say I'm a star I say thank you
It's all due to the scenes that I ran through
So I keep flyin the flags for all people
No messing about we're all equal
Vibe alive in the club when I roll in
I get around with the crowd when I'm roaming

[Hook: Ms D]
Everybody right now, can you hear me?
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me

Everybody right now, can you hear me?
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me

[Verse 2: Wiley]
They should know I bring vibes on a club night
Keep the crowd hyped up brother party
Red, she wanna say words in my earlobe
Reminds me there's an hour of the party left
See the fireworks, celebration, team winning the Grey Goose amazing
Send them Jägerbombs, I got a craving
So many women I don't wanna stop raving
They should know I got tunes for the gyal dem
Once the ladies are there see the man dem reach
They wanna leave there with a number
Check the peng ting she's gonna hang with me
I'm skanking all round the party I'm skanking
I got girls to the left and girls to the right
When we're at the bar we ain't ramping

Wiley called me on the iPhone
He said get my passport, told me to come through
Put your sun cream in your suitcase
When I arrive I'm causing a heatwave too
Got my snapback and my vest on
Looking at the hot girl with the red dress on
Light skin with a beautiful body like Kim so I had to get my Kanye West on
She told me she's feeling my jewellery
She said that she's in love with my Jesus piece
I told her to look again closely
It's not Jesus, baby, it's Jme
And I was like baby, come over
I don't bite girl, come a little closer
Come a little closer
I don't bite girl, come a little clo-

Everybody right now, can you hear me?

[Verse 4: Jme]
You know I don't usually party
But Skepta and Wiley said it's a hype
I can't find my phone or my car keys
Like Zippy Tafari said on the mic
The vibe is off the Richter
And I can't even tweet a picture
I'm on the dance floor, the joke is
I never had a drink but I'm acting the drunkest
She's staring like I'm a weirdo
Or then again maybe she likes me
I'm not supposed to be here though
Haven't got a wrist band for the VIP
No triple A pass
But I'm partying with the stars
Yep, I can't complain
I just enjoy while it lasts

Kulturelendsvoyeurismus,Pöbel MC,"

[Part 1:]
Toys perplex mit der Spiegelreflex
Untermauern tausendfach ihren Spiegelkomplex
Bekitschte Ekelselfies mit Achsensymmetrie
Pseudokünstlerkinder in Selbstdarstellungshysterie
Belanglose Landschaften, schwarz-weiß-retrogefiltert
Mir dreht sich der Magen, seh' ich, wie ihr euch bebildert
Ob punkig verwildert oder mit Photoshop-Teint
Deine dumme Fresse bleibt ein ästhetischer Fauxpas
Auf einmal macht hier jeder Pfosten auf Kunst und Fotograf
Ihr kulturverwirrten Pseudohipster werdet heut' bestraft
Denn ich renne durch die Stadt und kicke Keckos in die Kamera
Verteile flächendecken Bomben, wie Amerika in Kandahar
Ohne Kommentar, komm mal klar, bekackter Billigpoet
Deine Vorstellung von Kunst ist nur billig und beschämend
Fick deine Gammeltattoos, dein bepopeltes Septum
Du geistiges Insektum mit dei'm belanglosen Spektrum
Happy, schön, öko, cool, sexy und frei
Visueller Einheitsbrei ist 'ne beschauliche Kartei
Kulturelendsvoyeurismus weiß ich eigentlich zu schätzen
Doch der Schwachsinn artet aus in sozialen Schleppnetzen
Mir schwillt der Kamm, ich bekomm' Bock auf Bildschirmboxen
Im Grunde müsst' ich mir den Schwachsinn gar nicht anglotzen
Doch wenn Toys mich ankotzen, box' ich Kitschästhetik
Mit rhetorischer Athletik

[Part 2:]
Der Anblick ist öde, doch nix gegen Kecks die schwätzen
Machen Action auf ihren Allgemeinplätzen
Jeder geistige Tiefflieger macht auf Tastaturkrieger
Im wahren Leben nur ein Lappen, doch Netz endlich mal Sieger
Und der biedere Bürger zeigt seine rassistische Fratze im Netz
Neo-Neonazis ohne Bomber, ohne Glatze, sondern Storchgestalten
Am Rechner mit 'nem Schokoeis
Erzählen überdreist hinterunterletzten Nazischeiß
Und behaupten dann, es sei ins falsche Licht gerückt
Doch letztlich wird gezielt dem Mob die Fackel in die Hand gedrückt
Flüchtlingsheime brennen, Menschen soll'n sich fürchten
Die Krise als Geschenk, noch mehr Hass wollt ihr erwirken
AfD-Penner, PEGIDA und wie sie alle heißen
Es ist kaum zu fassen, wozu sich diese Kecks erdreisten
Opportunisten und Faschisten, Vollidioten und Rassistenadel
Mit Schwachmatengesabbel sinnvoll wie W-LAN-Kabel
Überschreiten meine Schmerzgrenze, dann wird auf sie geschossen
Im Sinnbild der Ironie fällt vielleicht der Groschen
Kulturelendsvoyeurismus weiß ich eigentlich zu schätzen
Doch der Schwachsinn artet aus in sozialen Schleppnetzen
Mir schwillt der Kamm, ich bekomm' Bock die Kecks zu boxen
Denn der Scheiß ist ja real, da hilft auch kein Back-Knopf
Also zerbox' ich besorgte Bürgerästhetik
Mit Rhetorik bis Athletik

[Verse 1: Pure Knowledge]
Living in a movie, sorta cinematic
I'm not a min into it, I got some sickening habits
I decided that I'd rather go and get the carrot than buy a carrot
Just for heard it call me silly rabbit
You need a diamond in order to symbolize your love and marriage
And life savings and hope you gets to ride the carriage
An investment that I watched whittle and slowly perish
Come up short and now you have to ride with your parents
Come and kick it with the kid like it's hackey sack
Cause I'm dropping with this aura of a 90s swag
I mix gratitude with a form of latitude
Then turn up and watch the numbers start to catapult
Forever been a devil on my shoulder that wants me to fall
But i've noticed as I've gotten older the angel i've come accustomed
I've grown to hold closer
A rockstar that started off as a boulder

It's your world though things change I'm still the same
Concentrating my unobtainable energy
Peace walks so we walk to reach fame
Goddamn I'm Hitchcock my gold frames
Looking down from my tower
Remember having no power
I scream it louder and louder yeah I'm a made man
Freestyle in the car to big payments
Sleepwalking in expensive places
Sold out shows, designed my clothes
Believed a lil me could change the whole world
Bear witness, calling all the freaks of the land
You know I'm keeping it litty I feel it put up your hands

From within genetic memory
A hunger arises
To master all skills
To wield unlimited power

Dreams are blown away like autumn leaves
Rain will keep on falling when I'm gone

To leave a mark and make it last
Explore every way to excel
Nothing will stand in the way of perfection
Leave natural weakness behind

Greatness comes with great pain
Sound of reason must be silenced
One man can't change evolution
I must rise above all

My enemies will fall
When a new dawn
Of ultimate life
Has arrived
Flawless, second to none
Perfection ready to rise

Dreams are blown away like autumn leaves
Rain will keep on falling when I'm gone
Will no one recall my name
When years have sealed me into the ground

The wind is blowing across the mountain
Down on the valley way below
It sweeps the grave of my darling
When I die that's where I want to go

Lord, send the angels for my darling
And take him to that home on high
I'll wait my time out here on earth love
And come to you when I die

I hear a voice out in the darkness
It moans and whispers through the pines
I know it's my sweetheart a calling
I hear him through the walls of time

Lord, send the angels for my darling
And take him to that home on high
I'll wait my time out here on earth love
And come to you when I die

Our names are carved upon a tombstone
I promised you before you died
Our love would bloom forever darling
When we rest side by side

Lord, send the angels for my darling
And take him to that home on high
I'll wait my time out here on earth love
And come to you when I die...

Our fair country Canada
Is north of the USA
Our Maritimes are lovely
And our prairies give us hay
You might think you Yankees
Are better than us Canucks
But we don't need no microchips
Inside our hockey pucks

We know that you've got disneyworld
And you keep it very clean
We dont have Bob Dole
And we can drink when we're 19
We may watch your TV shows for hours and hour and hours
We'll give you Alan Thicke
But Shania Twain is ours

We're proud to be Canadian
We're awfully nice to strangers, our manners be our curse
It's cool in many ways to be Canadian
We won't say that we're better, it's just that we're less worse

Your beer is not too tasty
And your weather can't be beat
We all fly south in the winter time
To escape the snow and sleet
We're pleased to say that
We've enjoyed all your southeren charms
But we get sun burnt
When we exersice the right to bare our arms

We're proud to be Canadian
We're awfully nice to strangers, our manners be our curse
It's cool in many ways to be Canadian
We won't say that we're better, it's just that we're less worse

She is our latest pride and joy
She used to sing about High school dances
And chasing after boys
But now she is fed up
And as angry as can be
She's got one hand in her pocket
And the other on guard for thee

We're proud to be Canadian(proud to be canadian)

And no entrance in or around it escapes like a thief in the night

Where you had all the things you want to say and the things you Would do

And how do you find the strength with all that’s done
To just move on to just let go

A feeling so true there’s no more hiding in your eyes

Kikesa, Nouveaux Hippies Gang
Entre eux et moi, y a pas d'compet
""Wesh Kik, t'es pas bon mec""
Ah bon, pardon, sale con
J'fais salle complète
Remets l'truc dans son contexte
J'ai 2 heures pour écrire mon texte
J'suis l'meilleur en si peu temps
Et ça plus personne le conteste

[Couplet 1]
Même pas l'temps d'apprendre les paroles
J'tiens mon tel comme j'tiens ta daronne
Tu dis très fort qu'ma zik est pas bonne
Pourquoi y a autant d'gens qui s'abonnent
Et y a si peu d'monde qui m'talonne
Salut, salam, chalom, salope
Les meufs me draguent plus, elles me Shazam
J'vais tout droit quand toi tu slalomes
Ils sont essoufflés, j'les mange au souper
Ils sont dégoûtés, j'les finis au goûter
Soit, j'suis déchiré, soit, j'écris des couplets
Si j'fais aucun des deux, c'est qu'je joue à 2K
J'lui lance des cailloux, j'lui lance des hadoukens
Leur carrière est mise à la poubelle
Les filles, j'suis en couple et vous n’êtes pas toutes belles
Arrêtez d'être jalouses, je ne vais pas vous ken
J'oublie c'que j'dis, je dis c'que je veux
J'ai quatre fois plus de flow que de cheveux
Y a pas vraiment d'thème, maman j't'aime
J'fais tout c'que je peux pour te rendre heureuse
Oui, oui, j'fais des hits, oui, j'fais du quidditch
Mec oui, c'est inouï, j'vis comme un inuit
Les hippies ont débarqué, j'mets des noms sur des barquettes
J'casse des chevilles sur des parquets
Catch'N'Shoot j'suis démarqué
Ils se branlent sur mes maquettes
Ils veulent perturber ma quête
J'les vois parler dans mon dos
Sans jamais tourner la tête
J'sais pas si j'suis un rappeur
Ou si j'suis juste un putain d'génie
Une journée en stud', un Zénith
Dans ma ville, ce fut un délire
Petit fils de pute atterris
Tu peux m'test mais c'est à tes risques et périls
J'monte à Paris pour les labels
J'suis du pain béni

[Pré-Refrain]
Salut vous êtes bien sur le répondeur de P.Prod
J'ai vu que Kikesa avait leaké mon numéro sur Insta
Du coup pour me venger, j'ai décidé d'mettre un extrait
Du prochain DDH en répondeur
Enjoy !

Sans cesse, on gère en pétant les scores
J'mets jamais mes sous dans tes poches
On n'est pas proches, non même pas potes
J'sais qu'on vit une putain d'époque
J'écris mes couplets sur d'la K-POP
J'vais plus au taff, j'vais plus en cours
Dans quelques jours, je pars en tournée
Bonne journée, bonne bourre
Les gens comme vous, sont mal entourés
J'fais des grosses, j'fais des petites scènes
C'est moi qui tire les ficelles, j'ai appelé le 17
Car je crois que ton équipe saigne
Tu fumes des pet', père ,j'fais des belles perfs
J'sais plus comment faire, frère
J'sais plus comment perdre, merde

[Verse 1]
This woman is growing weary
Of having to be so strong
Of having to pretend I'm made of stone
So I won't end up with no broken bones
I can't fight every battle alone
I want someone to lift me
Heal my wounds and give me kisses on my head
Say words that should be said
Fear is not the matter
I would so much rather open up my heart
And lay down my guard

[Chorus]
If I could trust someone
To have my back and never do me wrong
Then I would give my love up
Just like that, stop singing this soldier song
If I could trust someone
To have my back and never do me wrong
I would - I would give my love up
Just like that, stop singing this soldier song

[Verse 2]
Whomever said love is overrated
Must not be getting none
My independent days have had their fun
But when the party’s over
And the working day is done
I just want to come home to someone
I want a love to take me as I am
Not make me compromise myself
Or be like no one else
Fear is not the matter
I would so much rather open up my heart
And just lay down my guard

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I want someone to lift me
Heal my wounds and give me kisses on my head
Say words that should be said
I want someone to lift me
Heal my wounds and give me kisses on my head
Say words that should be said

Last night I had a wonderful dream about you (dream about you)
Last night I had a dream; hope that it will come true

Last night I had (sho-bop, sho-bop) a wonderful dream (sho-bop, sho-bop, a wonderful dream)
I dreamed I held you in my arms
And you thrilled me with your charms

In a wonderful dream (sho-bop, sho-bop, a wonderful dream) I had last night (sho-bop, sho-bop, a wonderful dream)
Your lips were, oh, so soft and warm
And a wonderful love (sho-bop, sho-bop) was born (love was born)
We were all alone, you told me that you care (told me that you care)
And I never will forget how happy I was that we were there

Last night I had (sho-bop, sho-bop, a wonderful dream) a wonderful dream
(sho-bop, sho-bop a wonderful dream)
And now that I'm alone with you
My wonderful dream (sho-bop, sho-bop) will come true (sho-bop, sho-bop a wonderful dream; sho-bop, sho-bop, a wonderful dream)

Apocalyptic Doomsday,Mr. SOS,"

[Intro]
This is for planet EARTH..
From the land to the SEA..
And the star known as the SUN..
Watching us from the SKY..
Hello planet EARTH..
We’re floating’ across the SEA..
Getting hotter than the SUN..
Taking you higher than the SKY..
Come on, planet EARTH..
I’ve got something you need to SEE..
You better heed the SUN..
And what’s left of the blue SKY..
Because Mother EARTH..
Is slipping off into the SEA..
While we burn under the SUN..
And levitate into the SKY..

This is for planet Earth (beneath my feet slipping by..) (Repeat)
Where am I?..

[Verse 1]
The writing’s on the wall but nobody’s able to understand it
A storm is brewing off in the Atlantic and it’s mammoth
Enough to conquer the planet by the dawn of the sabbath
Freezing rain & acid hail causing a panic
With damaging winds enough to wipe the planet of sin again & again
Welcome to the end of the end
Apocalyptic doomsday causing a flood
Turning bodies to mud in a tsunami of blood
The end of the world as we know it. Systems are now overloading
Soon as you see what’s important its too late
Vanity over-exposes. Sanity opens & closes
We need to close in and focus so we can save mother EARTH..
From the vultures tossing our corpses into the SEA..
Half eaten and rotten from lying in the SUN..
Non-believers searching for Jesus up in the SKY
But it’s too late. It’s their time to die

[Bridge]
“Hallucinations..” So strange
“Strange sensation.”
“Hallucinations..” These last days
“My creation..”
“Why do I oh why do I like to fly to the sky.”

[Verse 2]
Burning rivers through cities rising higher & higher
Now you know what it looks like when a building’s falling from fire
And what karma is. Falling planes with no targets
Hitting pyramids and turning monuments to burnt obelisks
All is worth nothing in a flash flood with a splash
Bigger than the lower & middle class
Used to be before they forever sleeped
The calm after this storm no one will ever see
All hands up towards the heavens as if they’re climbing there
All eyes shut tightly closed as if the light is unbearable
The sight is terrible and incredible enough to make the sickest criminal pray for a miracle then
EARTH cracks wide open and bleeds into the SEA
Hell fire touches God’s light from the SUN
The battle has begun is written up on the SKY
And I say may the best man die!

[Outro]
“Baby did you hear that? Yeah baby I heard it too..”
“The last chapters of revelations are coming true..”
“Baby did you hear that? Yeah baby I heard it too..”
“The last chapters of revelations are coming true..”

..On planet..
Earth beneath my feet passing by.. (repeat)

Where am I?..

À l'abri des passants tu
M'as dit des mots
Que j'ai trouvés pesants et

J'avais mal aux tympants
Presqu'autant qu'envie d'un temps d'arrêt

Tu me parles de moi
Tu me parles de toi
Tu me parles de nous deux
Le vent me sèche les dents
Et me plisse les yeux

Au bout d'un moment
Ayant cessé tes cris et tes pleurs
Très gentiment
Tu m'as poussé sur le moteur et

Tu me parles de moi
Tu me parles de toi
Et puis je ne t'entends plus
Le son me frise le front
Et je suis confus

Tu me parles de moi
Tu me parles de toi
Et me jettes l'encre dessus
Mes dents sont pleines de sang
Et mon coeur s'est tu

Je t'attendrai au paradis
Je n'ai rien compris

Twisting the Knife - 2016 Remastered,Alison Moyet,"

I watch it trickle from your lips
Pearls of ruby red soaking up your head until you want to push through
And then the world turns red
And the wine tastes sour
Pushing back the hand until the midnight hour

Every door is closing behind you
There's no one left to come and find you
You're soaking wet but the file won't dry you
I'd like to help but I can't stand by

And watch you twisting the knife
They've got you wasting your life
Can't stop you twisting the knife

Id rather turn out all the lights than see you like this
Caress me with your anger
Sting me with your kiss
You've been pushing too hard
I've been trying too long
Now I don't believe I have the will to carry on
You take it one step forward
Then it's two steps back
I'd jump the wire but I'm feeling trapped
Its other people make you insecure
I won't surrender like I did before

And watch you twisting the knife
They've got you wasting your life
Can't stop you twisting the knife
Surrender like I did before
Twisting the knife

Sting me with your kiss
You take it one step forward
Then it's two steps back
I'd jump the wire but I'm feeling trapped
Its other people make you insecure
I won't surrender like I did before

And watch you twisting the knife
They've got you wasting your life
Can't stop you twisting the knife

Opening scene, alone in the glow of the screen
You awoke from your dream to breaking news
For it seems you’ve misplaced the remote
Don’t you want to be brain washed with a variation of soaps?
Then just sit at home and never miss a moment?
Got questions? Pause the action before you ask them
Your fear levels are already topped up change the channel hurry

From philosophy and sacred geometry
To watching the X-Factor and playing the Lottery
While we neck spirits like they were dumber back then init?

Cause how you going to know what to buy if it isn’t advertised to ye’?

What is life? Ignore that benign tumor
And keep yourself distracted with plastic tits
And talentless blonde haired blue eyes savages
With overpriced veneers and over hyped careers
You wish you could close your eyes and ears

Diene der Party,Pascow,"

Tot ist die Queen! Der DJ lebt und
Kurz vor Panik spielt er gern sein Lieblingsstück
Das alle kennen, das alle kennen
Das alle kennen, doch ein Folk Song ist das nicht

Das ist nicht meine Zeit, ich will sie gar nicht haben
Es geht voran, zwölf Stunden Schicht, gereizter Magen
Hast Du den Takt gefunden? Magst Du das Pumpen?
Es schlägt in Dir, doch Dein Herz das ist es nicht

Die Geister, die man ruft, werden auch bei Regen bleiben
Der größte Trick des Teufels war es, sich so klar zu zeigen
Das Laufrad läuft am besten, wenn man es gleich selber tuned
Das ist schon fresh, aber manchmal nicht genug

Sand zu Öl, Mut zu Fleiß
Denn ohne Arbeit wärst Du viel viel viel zu klein
Noch was mit Wachstumsglauben? Was würde Yoda machen?
Ich kenn ihn nicht, doch ich weiß, er würde lachen

Und diese Feier kann uns alle noch von hinten sehen
Wenn wir mittendrin zu Fuß nach Hause gehen
Und die Moral der Geschichte ist halt wie sie ist

God Has A Plan For Us All,Angtoria,"

Let his holy choir sing in sodomy, praise be!
Surrender your body and your soul unto him, demoralize me!

So he crept into my room
Whispered my name, took my innocence away
I´m only five, a pervert's concubine

God has a plan for us all
I've been touched by the hand of god
My sordid tale, his lies are blasphemy

You do not believe in him but he believes in you
He wants you to repent all your sins. Let him in, inside you!

God has a plan for us all
You are one of God's children
Get on your knees, Serve him well, my child

I´ve fallen prey to the devil in disguise

God has a plan for us all
Don´t say a word or you'll go to hell
God has a plan for you all
Open up for him; let Jesus in!
His sordid tale, his lies are blasphemy!

Torn - Bonus Track,James TW,"

[Verse 1]
I thought I saw a girl brought to life
She was warm, she came around and she was dignified
She showed me what it was to cry
Well, you couldn't be that girl I adored
Don't seem to know, seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know her anymore

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's nothing where she used to lie
The conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine, I'm torn

[Chorus]
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor
Illusions never changed into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn

[Verse 2]
So I guess the fortune teller's right
Should've seen just what was there and not some holy light
It crawled beneath my veins and now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I don't care, I had no love
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things that I can't touch, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor
Illusions never changed into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn

We're tied together at the wrists

Why do we always stand so close to the window?
The locks rusted off years ago. (The clock)
A door-less morgue in the heavens and outside a seven story slumber

And don’t just shut your eyes And don’t just shut your eyes

Sweet Agony's playing her song, Grand pianos in the corner
A sweet Sonata painting the room black

This rooms so black...

An autopsy in the mirror
Don't just shut your eyes
An autopsy in the mirror
Don't just shut your eyes

Every time I look in the glass
I see the distance between the lights and the shadows

Booty bouncin with some big fat titties
Held up, I gots to hit this
Baby girl thicker than grandma grits
Jump in the lake and swim for that fish
Most of 'em mesmerized by my wrist
When I step in the club, blingin like this
While the bass pumpin the tweeters hits
Hit to the ear tryin to work my twist
Hey homey, watch this!
Hey hey, boo what's up wit'cho friend?

What?  Wait a minute, hold up

Don't pay to stick my pole in it
I'm cool with that
Don't want shit to do with that
I'ma throw you on the couch and make you scream ouch

By a ballin-ass nigga on dubs
To wine her and dine her and - give 'em hugs
To get they ass up out that club
When you slide up and down that pole
You got a brother like me on swoll
Upside down, fast and slow
You got my homies screamin ho
Let that monkey out of that cage
Got 'em all throwin dollars on the stage
Shake that ass and she get paid
How you think she bought that Escalade?
Ask the bitch you gotta man, she said no
Make my own dough, what I need one fo'?
All I wanna do is see dollars on the flo'
I'ma do it like a +Destiny+ ho, ""Independent""

Girl you're a lil' too young for me
Boo don't mess around and let Crawf get one off
That's it, I'm goin to sleep, see ya

Bend them blocks and, pay me
You know how many times, your boy done heard
What'chu doin, that's my lady?  Huh?
That's what she tellin you, man ain't what she said to me
Boy your girl so cold she givin out blows had me holla like Steve Harvey
HEY!  HO!  AH!  Had to hit it with the whole damn thang
I'm a one man gang when I'm runnin train it's like bang, bang, bang

Maybe it’s her walk

Por unos largos años tendré que amoldarme
A vivir en la prisión
Que me alejo de vos pero nunca de amarte
A vivir en la prisión
Que me alejo de vos pero nunca de amarte

Por acá está todo bien
Ya no hay nada que hacer
Camino como antes
Espero que me banques el tiempo que esperes sabré recompensarte

Y ahora hacer muy poco tiempo en esta triste celda me toca vivir
Sé que no serás mi vida pero si te tengo es más fácil seguir
Escucha lo que te pido quédate conmigo...
Yo te voy a hacer feliz

Mandale cumbia papaa

Aunque no te pueda ver
Ni te pueda tener conmigo como antes
Sabes que te extrañare
Que nunca olvidaré de lo que fuimos parte

Lo que paso ya paso

The Poconos,Hail Mary Mallon,"

[Bridge 1: Aesop Rock & Rob Sonic]
Hotel, motel, holy ghost
Razor blade, jailbait, over dose
Woke up pristine no one knows
What you did last winter in the Poconos

[Verse 1: Rob Sonic]
Ayo, he got the glass eye squint
Fab five time out and the hide out kids
Honey comb collective and the tae-bo kick
Little Billy posted by the blinds loaded
No shit, the swivel of the bar stool baddy
Pimp lane signal the single car pool caddy
Water witching the grinch in his large flat feet
Stitching his initials in skins and begin laughing
Bring back his body keep frosty
The eyes in the hill won't be still till they see raw meat
Hung from a hook in a nook of the barns loft beams
Auctioned and sold to the farmer in Charles charging
Antenna fender remember the raw dealings
Hard wired fired the liars abroad stealing
Spinning wheels for the meal of the dog heeling
Your hands under my feet and OG’ing the caught feelings
Dressed in his sloppy suit
You can hear him screaming from the inside of the locker room
Just another day in paradise pastrami chew
That leaves you face caved Aes make um Wally moose

[Hook: Aesop Rock & Rob Sonic]
Come on you can trust me
There's room on the floor and more in the front seat
The stuff in the trunk is just drugs and punk zines
No I've never driven and yes, death becomes me
Hail the king, hail a cab, hail satan
Hail Zoul and the full that I'm paid in
Hail the queen, hail a chief, hail caesar
Hail mary and carry in the believers

[Bridge 2: Rob Sonic]
Rescue gunner 5 by the frozen rope
Test tube butterfly swollen throat
Death cruise trucker bribe know one knows
What you did last summer in the Poconos

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
The rope-a-dope defense, close with it's own PS
""kick rocks"", city a necropolis for clipped locks
Tire piles, broken bones, cloven toe, piss-pot
Troma quotes exploding onto rotoscoped film stock
Firecane, half comotose, all killshot
Cough up, terrifying tales from the chaw cup
Twinkle twinkle little sinkhole, drinking decorative flamingos
Stippling a plastic lawn, picket fences, cats and dogs
Mallon juke left in bumper-to-bumper hazards on
Balance off, blackout, back for the Munsters marathon
Gather bad medicine, duffel bag, canteen, etch a sketch
Hula popper, cash, plaid pendleton
Smash and grab everything tetris'd in the sprinter
With the i'd rather be cutting the head off a serpent sticker
Perfect, dead youth flowin old habits
The getaway bus ride only so magic
Fact, he mostly know the company of roustabouts
Icky rathskellars where they sell lunch with the power out
Our gang, wallop on some honestly it's now or now
Donkey in his crosshairs, Bobby taking Bowser down

[Hook: Aesop Rock & Rob Sonic]
Come on you can trust me
There's room on the floor and more in the front seat
The stuff in the trunk is just drugs and punk zines
No I've never driven and yes, death becomes me

My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Jag vill leva i Europa - Live,Jan hammarlund,"

Pd... ®Org1982; Sv#x. {Pd®AlsoCv: Arja Saijonmaa(1987 Sv#2(OnCh870517:14w); Ect...}. ...Pd

Pd... Vi tog färjan till Travemünde
Vår resa började så
Fyra vanliga svenska turister
I en gammal sliten Renault

Vi skulle till olika ställen
Och vi kände knappt varann
Men för att spara bensin och pengar
Kunde sällskapet nog gå an

Vi vände och vred på vår karta
För att hitta en praktisk väg
Till Nice via Hamburg och Brüssel
Och helst också över Genève

Vi var alla ganska beresta
Och kom med en mängd förslag
På nya och spännande platser
Där man gott kunde stanna en dag

* Jag vill leva i Europa
Jag vill älska och sjunga här!
Jag vill skratta och gråta och dansa
Jag är yr och förlorad och kär!
När jag tänker på hela Europa
Och på oss som hör hemma här!

Långt ute på Tysklands hedar
Blev vi hejdade av en transport
En konvoj av NATO-raketer
På väg mot okänd ort

Deras tyngd fick marken att skälva
Där vi satt i vår bil och såg på
- Där är döden, sa Lena från Småland
Den är avlång och silvergrå

- Den ska till bergrum, sa Anders
Och riktas mot Leningrad
Där finns ett torg med små gummor
Som säljer rönnbärsmarmelad

Vår död väntar nog i Sibirien
Eller kanske i Texas, sa jag
Varje stridsspets har ett nummer
Som står för en särskild stad

Pd... * {Refrain:}
- Jag känner en kille i Grekland
Sa Lena, han står i en bar
Aten heter staden han bor i
Undrar vilket nummer den har

Jag tror B103 är för London
Sa Anders, där har jag en vän
Han jobbar på British Muséum
Men det var ju länge sen

I Provence är bergen röda
Och citronträdsblomman vit
Nummer C 87 har den robot
Som väntar på att sändas dit

- Det var här allting började, sa Peter
Som hade varit tyst en lång stund
Från Europa kom Cook och Columbus
Och det var här som jorden blev rund

- Som en mor med ondsinta söner
Och ett arv som ingen vill ha
Är Europa, sa jag. Ser ni floden
Rhen flyter sakta idag

Pd... * {Refrain:}
Jag såg in i backspegelns imma
Min blick var ganska betryckt
Den sa: Det finns flera millioner
Som lever i ständig flykt
Inte bara från sina länder
Utan från en hel kontinent -
Skulle du kunna leva som dom
Utan rötter, på vandring jämt?

Jag sa Men de kan vända tillbaka
Komma hem igen en dag!
I en framtid när allt är förändrat
Deras bit av jorden finns kvar
Men med den kontinent där vi lever
Repeteras en tragedi
Där författarna kallas strateger
Och dom som dör i slutet är vi...

Jag vill leva i Europa
Jag vill älska och sjunga här!
Jag vill skratta och gråta och dansa
Jag är yr och förlorad och kär!
När jag tänker på hela Europa
Och på oss som hör hemma här! ...Pd

Buio pesto, terzo pit
Giuro c'ero e resto qui
Rubo le tue forze come i demoni dei Cherokee
Tutto questo tempo perso appresso chi?
Sole nero a mezzo dì
Scendo giù dal cielo assieme agli Elohim
La mia apocalisse in alcool
E va giù liscio come a Machu Picchu un altro scalpo
E cado fisso come di chi droga visse e intanto
La mia mise nel piatto
È rabbia mista al pasto
Finché sbratto e chiama la mia miss se piango
Ogni verso è un Necronomicon
Ho messo via il rimario poi ho colmato il divario da demonologo

Io palmo a palmo sopra i cocci dei miei errori coi tremori di chi blatera
Passo la mia vita chiuso in camera, ma mica cedo
Squarcio l'aria con le grida come in cima a un minareto

[Strofa 2]
Sto per strada come i cartomanti dove cambio sguardi
Passo avanti, con la testa indietro perché imparo tardi
Pago caro perché resto a scervellarmi
Faccio sempre scelte d'altri
Parlo e basta l'eco a sbeffeggiarmi
La mia opera è completa
E c'è la sabbia perché il tempo va da alfa a omega
Un canto sacro, Veda
Parto come mago e torno da profeta come Cristo
Voci fanno bere chiamo il cameriere ed obbedisco
Sbaglio da anni ma
Non bastano le mani e neanche il caldo per fermarmi qua
Ama o dammi l'anima
Quello che mi prendo, dono
Metto un drago a guardia come al vello d'oro ma tu azzeri la mia forza, Dalila

Oh uh
I see fingers, hands and shades of faces
Reaching up and not quite touching the promised land
I hear pleas and prayers and a desperate whisper saying
Oh Lord please give us a helping hand
Yeah, yeah

Way down in the background
I can see frustrated souls of cities burning
And all across the water vapor
I see weapons barking out the stamp of death
And up in the clouds I can imagine UFO's jumping themselves
Laughing they saying
Those people so uptight, they sure know how to make a mess

Back in the saloon my tears mix and mildew with my drink
I can't really tell my feet from the stones on the floor
But as far as I know
They may even try to wrap me up in cellophane and try and sell me
Brother sell me, and don't worry about looking at the storm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I can see just who you are
You are you are the missing part
The only living boy left in the world

What’s the city done to you?
You’re walking down Fifth Avenue
You’re looking for salvation in a girl

If you get what you receive
It comes down to what you believe
Do you believe you’re someone she can love?

Life is like a lonely gun
Point it at the lonely ones
Will the final bullet be enough?

You’re the creation
You’re the reason
You’re the rising sun and the colors in my mind

You’re the changing of the seasons
You’re the growing old and the passing of the time

You live
You learn
You laugh
You cry
And you can never get enough

You drink
You dance
You fight
You die
And maybe you believe in love

Maybe you believe in love…

I know who you want to be
You want to be good company
But everything you say gets turned around

So you decide to be alone
You disconnect your telephone
And run off to some place you can’t be found

Everybody needs a friend
Who will love you in the end
Can you be somebody they can trust?

Change your mind and change your life
Find yourself a pretty wife
And be a man
Until you turn to dust

You’re the creation
You’re the reason
You’re the rising sun and the colors in my mind

You’re the changing of the seasons
You’re the growing old and the passing of the time

You live
You learn
You laugh
You cry
And you can never get enough

You drink

You fight
You die

The little yellow birds
Do they cry for me
Or do they cry with happiness ?
They look down on me with tiny eyes
Do they see my tears?
They seem to flutter by so carelessly
Do they hope I have some seeds ?
They land beside me without any fear
Do they see my tears ?
There is the open sky where a warm breeze blows
Still the birds stay close by me
Do they want some hair to make a nest for spring
Or do they want to dry my tears ?

Apocalypse slayer, I'm the street nigga terminator
Is it in my nature to be another life taker?
Then I ask 'em why home invader?
Strapped with the auto and razor
These days madness, raising havoc, witness savage
Blazing automatics in the midst of highway traffic
Very graphic
I rob and kick a burglary kidnapping
They think it's just 'bout rapping
But sometimes we get to capping
Niggas snapping
You motherfucking bitches make me bored
Let's go to war
If you think the world is really fucking yours
If we must fill the morgue
Then we will fill the morgue
If we must kill these boys
Then we will kill these boys
Let's destroy all who cross the path
A hypnotize blood bath
Try to reach and grab
You will feel the aftermath
I'm the trial, I'm the DA, I'm the lawyer and the judge
If you wanna feel the slugs
Then I let you feel the slugs

Don't make me kill, don't make me kill somebody [x4]

Aw shit nigga you done pissed me off
Now nigga now it's time for a killing
Buck buck shots blasting
Who I be Scan fucking Man
From the Killa Klan
Got my thugs from the south
Heavily armed and caused out
Better bring it
When you bring it
Cause if you don't that means you fucked
Cause those killers from the world
Won't hesitate to pop those slugs
Have yo mammies and yo pappys
And yo motherfucking grammies
Fuck yo poppa was because
You too damn greedy with that money
Now I told you don't test
And you did something, pity
You wasn't shit
Blaze something about your motherfucking prints
The patience of this game
You best to learn
Trying to have it all
You gon' fall
We gon' make sure of that
Hoe we gon' make sure of that
Decipher or stress that
Me blasting with my tech
You test
I'll flex
I'll bring the sawed
Three buck shots in your vest
I'm making motherfuckers feel what I feel
This shit is real
Motherfuckers who miss
Consider them graves
Don't make me murder you bitch

Get your dogs off me, pimping
It ain't no slipping
I'm running 'em on ya
MC Mack from the Killa Klan click
Got haters sick
Like they had pneumonia
Free me from this three way junction
Before I proceeding to take his life
And though I had them tear da any thugs from the southside
Ready to blast on site
Weapons blasting nice and fasting
Got you dashing
Spray this boy
Calling up my band of Hollywood niggas
Whatever they ready for war
Let's let's make a stain
A stain on the lane
Youngin done hipped me to the game
Bitches choosing out the frame
Is it the fame or is the the cheese?
Hoes be trying to smoke on my weed
And know that Mac done broke the laws
Or pay the dues for the things you see
Bitch please break your knees
Get off my chrome and get your own
Carla hit me on my horn
And said your momma ain't at home
It's a hypnotize, kamikaze
Prophet Posse, like the nazis
You ain't with the camp
Wack producers trying to fucking copy
Stop stealing buster nigga
Bitch go check the sound scan
We cashing checks and flipping that
These haters will never learn
Don't make me kill nigga

Recht Door Zee,De Dijk,"

Eerst was ik nergens bang voor en wilde recht door zee
Al kon ik dan niet zwemmen - alsof dat er iets toe deed
Maar iemand had het over muien en ik wist niet wat het was
Maar het klonk wel knap gevaarlijk dus bleef het bij geplas
In het lauwe pierebadje met mamma die goed keek
Hoe ik trainde op de crawl voor de grote oversteek

Ik was haast nergens bang voor en wilde recht door zee
Bij eb bouwde ik forten maar de vloed die nam ze mee
Ik dook, ging kopje onder, de zee was overal
Ik worstelde, kwam boven met aan mijn been een kwal
En ik holde naar mijn vader, die hakte hem in twee
Dus nooit bij oostenwind, maar verder recht door zee

Ik was haast nergens bang voor en wilde recht door zee
Maar de stormbal was gehesen en mama die zei: nee
Weet je nog die Duitser? Maak eerst nog maar een fort
En dan mag je recht door zee zodra de zee wat kalmer wordt
Dus ik zocht naar mooie schelpen en schepte in het zand
En bouwde droomkastelen voor aan de overkant

Ik was haast nergens bang voor en wilde recht door zee
We gingen op de brommer - een paar meiden wilden mee
Ik dacht niet meer aan zwemmen, ik dacht alleen aan haar
We strandden in een duinpan en doken op elkaar
We zouden het wel klaren al wist niemand hoe dat moest
Met zijn tweeën recht door zee, al was die nog zo woest

We waren nergens bang voor en wilden recht door zee
We doken in de boeken over 's werelds wel en wee
Over het reilen van de aarde, het zeilen van de mens
Langs klippen en gevaren tot aan de grenzen van de wens
Over wie die heeft getrokken en hoe scheef dat is gedaan
En hoe dwars je moet gaan liggen om recht door zee te gaan

Ik ben haast nergens bang voor en wil graag recht door zee
Maar ik zwem droog op de playa in een wolk van factor 2
Want de zee is onbegaanbaar verpest in hart en wier
Wie duikt komt niet meer boven, wie worstelt komt niet hier
Wie oefent op het droge slaat meestal in de lucht
Wie ooit eens recht door zee wou boekt nu een campingvlucht

After the Ending,John Frusciante,"

Pain runs through life
Pleasures' other side

Fear, some say, gives us such long lives
Leads us where we drive

Time will soon be born
It is starting at the dawn

And the world is moving towards
Things like opposites and wars
And one knows to hear birds sing
There was nothing 'til the beginning

And the water from my eyes
Is because I care who dies
Although death is transforming
There is nothing after the ending

Everything is eternal
Nothingness does not exist
No thing has ever become nothing
And nothing has never become something
What is has always been and will always be

Crimson drops on the scarred white sand
Blood spilled in an unknown land
Contours of hills
In the distance like bone
Shrouded in mist they remind me of home

The singer forgiven for you loved his song
Choking on words that froze on your tongue
The waves rush in
As my footsteps fall
Flightless I leap, silent I fall

So many tears
Cried at night
Distort the past
Deny my sight

Dissolution of envy
Vanity was always on your side
Blinded by the giving sun
I close my eyes and see what I've become

Unspoken words can never lie
But in your eyes the fascination fades
Hold my gaze and look away
The changing stars that lead me astray

So many tears
Fill my dreams
Follow the tide
Defy the sea (Defy my dreams)

Flightless I leap
Silent I fall
Falling from grace
I can wait no more

Look so weak and feel so strong
That we get laughed at

With these vultures on my back

I get high just thinking about it

Put down your pills
Stop dreaming about it
Pick up your thrills
And shout about it

I'll read you my poems
You tell me what you think
If you promise not to laugh at them
So I look to my friend
Who tells me the truth
He says that I am cured
I'm cured, I'm cured

Here come the boys
Who make that noise to keep you happy
Sink or swim we'll get to ring

J'vais détourner ton zinc

Où tu vas qu'il me dit poli
J'en sais rien je réponds surpris
Je veux juste être libre
Et savoir le pourquoi
Pouvoir dire ce que j'ai à dire
Mais sans risquer la mort ou pire
Sans qu'on fasse de moi
Ce que je ne suis pas

Mais le pays dont tu parles
Ça n'existe pas
J'aimerais te faire plaisir
Mais ça n'existe pas
Même dans mes souvenirs
Vraiment je vois pas
Je n'ai connu que pire
Je t'en prie crois-moi
Range ton revolver
Je vais t'expliquer, calme-toi

J'voudrais bien t'éviter
D'user de mon flingue
Mais si tu continues
J'fais péter la carlingue
Me regarde pas comme ça
Comme si j'étais un dingue
Si y a rien sur la terre
Qu'est fait pour me plaire
T'as qu'à m'emmener ailleurs
Dans ton univers
Vers un monde construit
Dans un autre décor

Je te parle pas du paradis
Mais d'un sentiment bien plus fort
Où si tu donnes ta vie
On pardonne ta mort
Mais le pays dont tu parles
Ça n'existe pas
J'aimerais te faire plaisir
Mais ça n'existe pas
Même dans mes souvenirs
Vraiment je vois pas
Je n'ai connu que pire
Je t'en prie crois-moi
Range ton revolver
Je vais t'expliquer, calme-toi

Y a des gens dans cet avion
Qui pensent autrement
Qui ont la même vie que toi
Mais qui sont contents
Qui suivent comme des moutons
Qui portent leur croix
Qui sont de vrais combattants
Mais chacun pour soi
Y'en a même qui sont bons
Tu dois respecter ces gens-là

Allez donne ton revolver
On va rien te faire
On dira rien à personne
J'en fais mon affaire
C'est vraiment ta dernière chance
Tu peux pas mieux faire
Montre ton intelligence
J'te parle comme un frère
Tu dois me faire confiance
Redescends sur la terre

C'est comme ça qu'un jour plus tard
C'était la déglingue
Chemise cousue sur mesure
J'étais chez les dingues
Ils m'ont piqué ma ceinture
Mes lacets, toutes mes fringues
Toutes les heures, une piqûre
Cachets et seringues
Me font la vie moins dure
Ou me rendent un peu plus dingue

Mais le pays dont je parle
Ça n'existe pas
Mais le pays dont je parle
Ça n'existe pas
Je me sens bien chez les fous
Je me sens chez moi
Je me sens bien chez les fous
Je me sens chez moi
Ça n'existe pas
Ça n'existe pas
C'est comme ça qu'un jour
C'était la déglingue
Chemise cousue sur mesure
J'étais chez les dingues
Ils m'ont piqué ma ceinture
Mes lacets, toutes mes fringues
J'deviens de plus en plus dingue...

Who's that boy in the back of the club?
Is he playing hard to get 'cause he's so damn hot
I'm bending over backwards to catch his eye
I wonder if he knows how hard I try

Maybe I should just let him know where I stand
Would he be impressed if I said I'm in a band?
Might be a little bit over the top
I bet he's gonna tell me to shut the fuck up... shut the fuck up

Here boy
Get down boy
Be a good boy

Who's that boy with that pretty little ass
I could beat around the bush or make a pass
I know we gonna make a perfect match
It shouldn't be that hard, I'm quite a catch... quite a catch

Brand New Day,Big Scoob,"

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Every morning way in her eyes I see a brand new day
Opportunities arising, and I can't be late
Yesterday's so far away, that I can't turn back now
Because I know it's greater later, someway, somehow

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
It's my day, so I'mma tell my wife that I love her
How she stood up, and stood by, when the shit [?] went under
When the plug got disconnected, and I made a few blunders
I got sloppy, so I stumbled, what a way to be humble
Wasn't stressin', never flexin', never asked me a question
God must've seen me hurting, so he sent me a blessing
He sent heaven in the form of a girl, you my world
And I love you more than diamonds and pearls, you hear me, girl?
To my oldest daughter, all we do is fuss and fight
But baby, I'm your father, I've got to tell you wrong from right
I know you think you smarter, and I should let you live your life
That ain't the working order, see, I'm supposed to hold the light
To help you see father, if you ain't ready for your flight
Then you gon' fall harder, that ain't my vision for your life
But, I'mma try harder, to let you learn to live your life
But if you need me, holler, and I'll be there to make it right

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Every morning way in her eyes I see a brand new day
Opportunities arising, and I can't be late
Yesterday's so far away, that I can't turn back now
Because I know it's greater later, someway, somehow

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
On this day, I choose to raise the souls of the dead
And change the loss so all my dogs'll make it home from the feds
Cure my granny from diseases, set her memory free
So I can call her, say ""I love you"" and she'll know that it's me
Then I go platinum in a day, and I go double the next
So I can start my sister's business with mechanical checks
With no fed investagation, how it come with the bread
Monsterifik so terrific, feds boppin' their heads
Then give my [?] and show him shit can be right
We ain't got to grit and grind or fuss some fight to get stripes
Have the world screamin' villain, mass appealing, we kill them
Resurrecting all our soldiers from the grave and in prison
Put the hood up on my shoulders, tell them follow the dough
Can't defeat us, I'm elitist, till we hounding the hall
Boy, it's my day, it's my way, what I see, what I say
It's coming real soon, man, it's time for a new day

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Every morning way in her eyes I see a brand new day
Opportunities arising, and I can't be late
Yesterday's so far away, that I can't turn back now
Because I know it's greater later, someway, somehow

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
So now I take the chances, speak to three little girls
Baby Tracy, and my twins, that's the rest of my world
Try to teach them, hope I reach them, let them know they can fly
Break them chains, play them games, and be much colder than I
And in this world, right for pickin' better fruits of your labour
Just stay focused on your dreams, and keep your faith in the savior
Don't let the man change your plans, if it's love, let it keep it
He raise his hands, you take a stand and spill his blood with the heat
Remember, family's all that you got and I'll be here if you need me
No one can ever love you more than me, I hope you belive me
But now, it's time to let you fly, and take your place in the sky
Little ladies, almost women, with that look in your eye
Sophisticated, educated, keep on questioning why
Don't ever settle, chase them answers till the day that you die
Remember, daddy did his best, and tried to teach you the rest
The road was hard and it was stress, but y'all prepared for the test
Yeah

There was a time I could drink my cares away
And drown out all of the heartaches that hurt me night and day
When the thought of you came crashin' through, I'd have one more
But now the whiskey ain't workin' anymore

That's reason enough for me to lay this old bottle down
A woman warm and willing, that's what I'm looking for
'Cause the whiskey ain't workin' anymore

And they knew all of the reasons why I was coming round, round, round (sing it, Travis)

But now the whiskey ain't workin' anymore (sing it, son)

Mouth Full Of Sand,Averi,"

Fell asleep at the wheel the other night
And crashed into reality
It's a scary place to be, or so I found out
Without the faces that used to surround me

Like a pilgrim in the desert, I'm diving into air
Thinking there's water but nothing's there
Because I thought you were an ocean
But this view from where I stand
Has me leaving with a mouth full of sand

I didn't sleep well again the other night
Afraid to close my eyes and dream
I hate the fact that I feel like I need anything
To feel complete...
To feel like me

Like a pilgrim in the desert, I'm diving into air
Thinking there's water but nothing's there
Because I thought you were an ocean
But this view from where I stand
Has me leaving with a mouth full of sand

I didn't find it in religion
But I found it in love
I'll read the terms of agreement later
Just sign me up

Like a pilgrim in the desert...

Don't know what to say
Tell me what my heart is supposed to do

She won't be happy without love
No one is happy without love

Just wanted her name
But her protectors say I'm not allowed

She dreams of dreams and dreams
And one day will be Queen
She does not know how much I mean

She must remain a child
She thinks she is so wild
She cannot find her style
And yet, she moves

To a Poet,First Aid Kit,"

[Verse 1: Klara]
And you said, ""Don't give me nothing you don't want to lose""
I said ""Darling, I'll give you everything I got if I want, I'm to choose""
Then I got on a plane and flew far away from you
Though unwillingly I left and it was so, so hard to do

The streets here at home had rapidly filled up
With the whitest of snow
And they don't make no excuse for themselves
And there's no need, I know

[Chorus: Klara & Johanna]
Now I miss you more than I can take and I will surely break
And every morning that I wake, oh, there's this ache
But there's nothing more to it, I just get through it
Oh, there's nothing more to it, I just get through it

[Verse 2: Klara]
It always takes me by surprise how dark it gets this time of year
And how apparent it all becomes that you're not close, not even near
No matter how many times I tell myself I have to be sincere
I have a hard time standing up and facing those fears

[Pre-Chorus 2: Klara & Johanna]
But Frank put it best when he said, ""You can't plan on the heart""
Those words keep me on my feet when I think I might just fall apart

Under black age toil we live

That night the stars shot madly from
Their spheres and we're raging like a violent storm
And the moon that was no crescent but
His horns were visible within the circumference
One saw more devils vastest hell can hold

Within moonshine we left to bury the dead
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve

The pestilence has taken our eyesight
And our graves are gaping wide
Everyone sets forth his dying sprite
And the church way paths to glide
Through dead bodies - nor rich or poor
Anymore with stolen pride

Under black age toil we live

Oh scornful masters we leave our homes
Under black age toil our sweat runs bold
Let the pestilence resolve our end
We won't leave our fathers land
We won't learn trial patience for a customary cross

We've abandonded to relieve and heal
Even strong men with their hearts of steel
And the beggars, fools our knights and kings
Met the demon with this blackened wings

Present Tense,On My Honor,"

A child on church steps
Reminding me of me
Not in my current state
More content, more clean at seventeen
Whoever he’s talking to
I pray they’re listening
So he won't end up like me

Try to see the good in everything
But that young man’s eyes are not for me
They’ve been blinded and removed
Ground and lit and smoked by breaths too deep
I’m exhaling but my stomach stays week
Like I’ve swallowed any keys
That may unlock the answers I seek

[Chorus]
And still, I'm sweating through my sheets, too many nights on end
Talks and dreams of how I thought I’d be a better man
When I compare the past to my present tense
I’m as clean, as clean as I have ever been

Saw an old man sitting alone
Lunch on a holiday
Wondered who he used to see with him
And it sparked in side of me
The future that I used to see
The way I feel today
The visions that I used to paint
And the canvases in my basement sitting blank

Why can’t I accept what’s offered to me?
Why can't I accept what's offered to me?

Let's leave our heads for a day
When you got sick you said

Let's leave our heads for a day
When you got sick you said to wait for it to change
But it grew when you left and
I'm stuck with this weight on my chest

I'm betting on the breakers
I'm stuck with myself and the fact that I couldn't see

Through a thirteen year old lens
Which lends myself to believe
That I'm breathing in the same sea
That you breathed

The cancer that you fought
It brought a lot of pain
I'm itching at an old wound
I'm stitching up the seams

I get comfort from tales that I've heard
When you'd grab your girl and say

""I love you more than the dawn on the sea
Oh, what you mean to me.""

It's a far cry to say I got away

But that wasn't enough
I tried so many things that I just feel like giving up
This place is a prison now, darling and I can't find my way out
If only there was something that I could say without making you scream and or shout

But if it's coming down to the whoa oh whoa oh whoa whoa

Drug Free '05,Native Deen,"

[Chorous]
I don't need to get high, some people do and some people die
The life that I live may not be that long
But while I'm alive I'll be healthy and strong
I think it's cruel and inconsiderate
When people huffin' and they puffin' on a cigarette
Then blow the smoke in the area that I breathe
Sometimes they blow it in my face when they talk to me
I'm not trying to tell you that you need to quit
But you need to show respect for the one you're with
And if that's an individual who doesn't smoke
You need to put the cigarette out before they choke
You started smoking ‘cause you thought that it was cool
Now you addicted and you don't know what to do
Yeah you addicted to a drug baby that ain't smart
Because it collapses your veins damages your heart
And your lungs are getting blacker than you've ever seem
That's the effect of tobacco and nicotine
See what I mean
I don't need to get high, some people do and some people die
The life that I live may not be that long, but while I'm alive I'll be healthy and strong
Ain't no wisdom in that alcohol
They say, “Do you want it?” and I say, “Not at all”
They tell me that I need to take a drink to be cool
I tell ‘em, “Man, I'm already cool. What's up with you?”
Now is you crazy or is it that you didn't know
That every time you drink the alcohol you loose control
Become abusive to all the people that you love
After your buzz, can't remember what you thinking of
Oh yeah that drug ruins people and their families
They want it to happen to me but that's a fantasy
How can this be? I'm feeling pressure from the left and right
I'm watching TV and they tell me to drink Bud Light
Wasn't subliminal I got the message loud and clear
They want me spending all my money on a can of beer
They must be crazy trying to trick me like some kind of fool
They get me laughing at those frogs and iguanas too
Now is it true that if I drink I'll be the man?
No, that's a lie, so me I got a different plan
So understand that my mind sees reality
Like Mortal Combat can you say “Fatality”
Them tactics work on other people they don't work on me
Being drug free is the way that I want to be
Say it with me
I don't need to get high some people do and some people die
The life that I live may not be that long, but while I'm alive I'll be healthy and strong
I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't need
To get high, I don't mess with the weed
And my heart bleeds when I see my people on their knees
Beggin' like they got an incurable disease
Addictions start with a sip of a drink, one puff of a smoke
So the people need to think
And I do, so do you and your crew
When they push drugs on you what you gonna do? SAY
I don't need to get high, some people do and some people die
The life that I live may not be that long, but while I ‘m alive I'll be healthy and strong

[Music: Weston/Smail]

Cosmic pillars stand I'm my way
Shooting stars soon fall
Airtight blackness everywhere
You cry and I'm appalled

Vortex spins
Without fear
End of all
Is drawing near

Screaming shards rip into me
Others I can't feel
Lookin' 'round parallel corners
Distorting what is real

Hear your call
In the night
Right is wrong
And wrong is right

You talk in riddles I speak in rhyme
But yet the sun that never sets still ceases to shine
Reality fades in dreams of regret
I cannot remember but will never forget
The past is my present, the future's a lie
These are words to live by

Normalerweise kommt man so nicht in Clubs
Ich bin nicht modebewusst
Ich bin todes auf Suff
Doch ich kenn immer irgend ein
Und der bringt mich dann rein
Sagt ich soll mich benehmen
Ich tue so als wär ich nicht gemeint
Ich hab immer was zu trinken
Doch habe nichts bezahlt
Einer meiner Jungs klaut immer ein Flasche von der Bar
Ich trink jedes mal viel zu schnell und benehm mich dann wie ein Bauer
Jedes mal am Tag danach ist irgendjemand auf mich sauer
Irgendwas in meiner Tasche was mir vorher nicht gehörte
Ein voller Raum und irgendwie überforder ich die Hälfte
Denn ich pöbel ohne Grund, nur für meine Unterhaltung
Mit irgendwelchen Kekis [?] führ' ich keine Unterhaltung

Und jede denkt sie ist besonders innovativ

Auf Krampf immer die Dinge anders machen als sonst jeder
Und in eurer scheiß WG ist dann alles von Ikea
Lass mich raten, ihr hattet mich schon abgestempelt
Irgend so ein Straßenbengel und dann hab ich Argumente
Doch ich will euch nicht enttäuschen und wer meinem Ruf gerecht
Gib mir jetzt dein ganzes Geld ist auch für einen guten Zweck

We fall into old habits
Talk about giving it up after getting right on
Letter to your mother says you're doing everything you can
And I'm glad that she won't get the joke

You're as free as a ten year old
With a room of your very own
Doesn't matter at all what all those people say at home
With your good humour you're a hero

And you can stop them dragging you down
They've got nothing better to do
Sometimes you've got to laugh in their faces

It doesn't matter if your guitar is in hock
It doesn't matter if you owe us all a lot
'Cause you're getting happier by the minute
And they wouldn't have a clue about what it's like to be lazy
When you've got too much to do
Got too much to do

And you can stop them dragging you down
They've got nothing better to do
Sometimes you've got to laugh in their faces
Laugh in their faces
Laugh in their faces
Come on, laugh in their faces

I heard you laughing while you died, the pain is over
I heard you laughing while you cried - I hate to say goodbye
Warum fällt es dir so schwer, dich vor dem Sog zu schützen?
Warum hält es dich nicht mehr auf deinen Beinen, wenn du stehst?

Wo sind die Stimmen, wo ist der Lärm, der mich erinnert, dass ich bin?
Wo ist der Atem, wenn die Luft gefriert? Nimm ihn weg, zeig mir den Sinn!
Warum fällt es dir so schwer dich vor dem Lärm zu schützen?
Warum hält es dich nicht mehr auf deinen Füßen, wenn du stehst?

Ich hör dich lachen, wenn du stirbst, der Schmerz ist längst vorbei
Weiß nicht, warum du dich ergibst, war denn die Welt zu dir gemein?
Warum fällt es dir so schwer, dich vor der Welt zu schützen?
Warum hält es dich nicht mehr auf dem Boden, wenn du gehst?

Ich wusste nie, wohin wir treiben, wohin wir gehn, und wo wir sind
Wo kann ich stehn, wo kann ich bleiben, wenn der Pfad sich vor mir teilt?
Hast du ein Herz, um mich zu leiten, sind deine Worte mir ein Weg
Bläst du den Sturm aus meinen Sinnen? Du warst der Weg - Von Anfang an

Der Doppler-Effekt,Wise Guys,"

Na na na na na nananana...

Na na na na na nananana...

Steh ich neulich in Hürth
Da fahr'n die Bullen an mir vorbei, so mit voll Sirene an so und ich denk mir nur 'auwei'
Und dann hab ich gemerkt, während ich noch 'scheiße' rief, sind die an mir vorbei
Klingt die Sirene plötzlich schief
Ich war total geschockt und ich dachte 'bloody hell', doch ein Kumpel von mir sagte, ich erklär dir das mal schnell:

Der Schall besteht aus Well'n, das ist total normal, nach jedem Wellenberg, kommt so voll das Wellental. Die Schallwellen schaffen 1200 Sachen, das musst du diesen Wellen erst mal so versuchen nach zu machen
Kilometer, drei Sekunden, das ist 'ne ganze Menge. Den Abstand von zwei Wellenbergen nennt man Wellenlänge
Die Wellenlänge kürzer, das kommt dir nicht nur so vor, da sind viel mehr Wellenberge, so voll auf unser Ohr
Wellenberge pro Sekunde, Mann, das ist kein Scherz, die Wellenberge pro Sekunde, Mann, die nennt man Hertz

Christian Doppler hat das 1842 schon gecheckt, darum nennt man dieses Ding 'Doppler-Effekt'
Doppler war zweimal so schnell wie andere Entdecker, Doppler war total so voll der mega Doppelchecker !

Na na na na na nananana...

Der Doppler hat sich wirklich nur sehr selten geirrt, der wusste, dass die Wellenlänge immer kürzer wird, wenn sich so 'ne Schallquelle auf uns zu bewegt, womit sie dann für uns auch den Ton höher legt. Und wenn die Schallquelle schließlich wieder weiterzieht, da ist doch völlig klar, was so in unserem Ohr geschieht
Die Wellenlänge wird so größer, die Frequenz wird kleiner, der Ton wird für uns tiefer. So, noch Fragen irgendeiner?

Christian Doppler hat das 1842 schon gecheckt, darum nennt man dieses Ding 'Doppler-Effekt'
Doppler war zweimal so schnell wie andere Entdecker, Doppler war total so voll der mega Doppelchecker !

Na na na na na nananana...

Ich selber habe aber auch was eigenes entdeckt:
So manchmal wenn mir das Bier so richtig schmeckt, dann seh' ich alles zweimal und ich habe jetzt gecheckt, dass nennt man wohl den visuellen Doppler-Effekt

Na na na na na nananana...

I see you face up in the air
Brings back times when you were there
You've never been away that long
I recall that hidden smile
I didn't know why i cried
'cause i would see you back at home
So why was i all alone?
All seasons weep
When summer falls asleep
On the table i put the plates
""Hey, why are you too late
You know dinner's served at five""
I see the blue lights swing
And sirenes that sing
But i can't sing along
False notes prolong
Your eyes were closed
You mind far away resting for another shiny day
Humor, spontanity, you impressed me
Things you composed;
Laughing matters which you loved the most
Now a sign calls it all closed
And now i see just how much you meant to me
Dear sunshine, he could be a butterfly
At least you should have let him try
Dear sunshine, will the good things stay
If you believe in them every day

Well I tried and you lied, I was left here back in the blue

Is it because I'm out on the road?
You never had it good, you never had it anyway

I was always right there when you wanted to play
You were living in a scene from a dream every night and day
And I never found a way to make it better for you
Oh I tried and I tried but you left me back in the blue

If you're gonna run, are you gonna run today?
Is it because I'm out on the road?
You never had it good, you never had it anyway

What you gonna do now? Nothing left, nothing to say
Well I must have been a fool to believe in you anyway
When I tried to find a way or something that I could do
You threw it all in my face and you left me back in the blue

If you're gonna run, are you gonna run today?
Is it because I'm out on the road?

De kan stadig ik' fange mig
Kælling ved min side, hun vil bare have pik

De har fine tits, men de er bare kids
Fjorten plus er min grænse, men jeg giver dem en chance
De vil bare have mig, kom og tag mig

You Promised You'd Stay Here With Me,Empire! Empire! (I was A Lonely Estate),"

You always wear neutral colors
You are a forest of gray and brown
And your bed is always empty
Elizabeth was right
You keep your guard up higher than a castle wall
And your hands are always buried in your pockets

I know what happened
On the grounds of the school where you met
When you were carrying three months of salary spent
And I know how she found out
And how her father would never allow
Such a poor family name to lay claim his only daughter

So I know she never showed
And how you stayed for hours
Like a mariner trapped at sea
When dawn reclaimed the sky
You dragged your body home
Collapsing, at last, alone in your bed

You woke after little sleep
Shook the weight off your shoulders
And drove yourself down to the harbor
You walked onto the pier
Where the wind howled and shared your grief
Like it was part of your body
And you slowly removed the diamond ring from inside your pocket
And you buried it at sea

Autrefois pour faire sa cour
On parlait d'amour
Pour mieux prouver son ardeur
On offrait son coeur
Aujourd'hui, c'est plus pareil
Ça change, ça change
Pour séduire le cher ange
On lui glisse à l'oreille

Ah! Gudule!
Viens m'embrasser
Et je te donnerai
Un frigidaire
Un joli scooter
Un atomixeur
Et du Dunlopillo
Une cuisinière
Avec un four en verre
Des tas de couverts
Et des pelles à gâteaux

Une tourniquette
Pour faire la vinaigrette
Un bel aérateur
Pour bouffer les odeurs

Des draps qui chauffent
Un pistolet à gaufres
Un avion pour deux
Et nous serons heureux

Autrefois s'il arrivait
Que l'on se querelle
L'air lugubre on s'en allait
En laissant la vaisselle
Aujourd'hui, que voulez-vous
La vie est si chère
On dit: rentre chez ta mère
Et l'on se garde tout

Excuse-toi
Ou je reprends tout ça

On reçoit la visite
D'une tendre petite
Qui vous offre son cœur

Et l'on vit comme ça
Jusqu'à la prochaine fois

Not unless some intervention
Pushes me around
You move much like a go-go dancer

I'm unoriginal, it's fine
I wanna know about your zodiac sign

From ouija boards and daily beatings
Rule my hours. (So do those fabulous crystal powers.)
When Jean Dixon summons me
I hang on every word she puts my life in Tina Turner overdrive
With that you say I've lost my mind

Oo- the seventh house is rising fast
I'm a natural with a horse or a a rat
I'm unoriginal, it's fine
I think I love you and your zodiac sign

We are sailing in a ship that's got no sails
We are riding on a train right off the rails
We are in an old sedan that's lost a wheel
But it makes no difference to the way we feel

It's been a long time - seems like a lifetime
To be where we are
Take a little tumble, fall and maybe stumble
Now we've gone so far

All along the highways of the sun

No one knows how far it is we have to go
Because every step we take reveals some more
But we'll keep right on as far as the eye can see
Over there where land and sky appear to be

Cruising down the highways of the sun

All along the highways of the sun

Slow the clock that's ticking loud

Betting on myself, bet you never thought I would
Spreading all my wealth, that's the only way it should be

I got everything that I wanted, got the house and pool

But I didn't, I had my vices but my faith got me through
I know the finer things are nice, but they not why I pursue (why you do it?)
I do this to alleviate my mind-state
I do this to see a smile on my momma face
I do this to help you face what you can't escape
I do this cause there's a dream that I'm tryna chase
Who knew this would be the path that my life would take
I had to blow this game up I had to make a way! (Yuh!)
They changed up, don't need them anyway
Thought I was stuck, bossed up, now we getting paid
In the club, toasts up, as my record plays
It was all a dream now it's my reality

Jesus, I don't exist
Don't try to follow me
What the fuck is going on here?
You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?
It's not my fault, we hit a memory cap
Use your head you dumb bitch hes just acting out the secret agent role of his ego trip
But first lets get rid of the bug in your head
Take it out of the case and stick it up you nose
Get the reactor, free Mars
Don't worry its self-guiding, just shove read hard

Tira del carro y rueda con ritmo lento
Hasta que salga del barro nuestro alimento

Crecen las sierpes y huye retorciéndose

Vengo a buscar tu consuelo luna de agosto

En otros ojos de agua más pura querría mirarme
Mas siempre vuelvo a buscar tu sonrisa de sorna cruel

Vela conmigo, soy el insomne tu amigo

Do dziś w moich uszach

Na dachu wieżowca
Złożona przysięga
Że będziemy razem
Aż po czasu kres
Słodkie pocałunki
W odrapanej windzie
Byłaś jak obrazek
Włosy jak Kim Wilde
Gaz był na ulicach
Dokoła zamieszki
W radio leciał
Perfect albo Lady punk

Łyk taniego wina
By rozerwać szarość
Plastikowe klipsy
Miała każda z Was
Skończyliśmy szkołę
Wszyscy się żegnali
Łzy leciały gorzkie
Porwał nas zły świat
Wypłowiałe zdjęcia
I odbite usta
Szminką tak czerwoną
Jak gorąca krew
Zobacz nie kłamałem
Wtedy tamtej nocy
Będziesz w mej pamięci
Aż po samą śmierć

Nie wierząc że przyjdzie lepszy czas
Niosąc na swych barkach dni minionych ciężar

Ob ich was will? Ruppis? Steck die Dinger in´n Arsch
Seh ich so verjunkt aus wie die Kotti-Town-Penner?
Hast du gesehen? Der hat den anderen grad geklatscht
Und dass nur, weil der ihm nichts von seinem Bier gegeben hat
Ist schon scharf hier, siehst du da vorne die Straße?
Dass [????]-Bild ist von mir, dass steht da inzwischen acht Jahre
Hier hab ich 90 angefangen zu malen mit Murat und NOK
Der wurde später mit ner Schrotflinte erschossen
Die Tanke war bei Bassboxxx Bierlieferant
Und die Bombings da drüben waren von One Up grad der Anfang
Schönes Ambiente mit der U-Bahnlinie 1
Apropos, da vorne gibt´s ein Café, das auch so heißt
Ach nein, da gab´s ne Schießerei, die haben geschlossen
Wie beim Travolta, aber die haben noch offen
Das „O“ in ihrem Logo war ne Zielscheibe, im Ernst
Nach dem Vorfall haben sie die getauscht gegen ein Herz
Da, wo die Schuhe auf der Ampel hängen, ist Heinrichplatz
Beim Skateshop „Search“ holt mein Bruder Flo sich meistens Stuff
Dass ist die O-Straße, sauviel Schicki-Micki
Aber abends kriegt der freche Touri auch hier Stichi-Stichi
Dann eine weiter ist die Naunyn , die schon Ghetto ist
Und da beim O-Platz liegt die Dresdner, um die Ecke links
Ich wohn jetzt hier in der Gegend und fühl mich wohl soweit
Fick die Polizei, Peace an die erste [????]

Ich tret vor meine Tür, und steh am Herrmannplatz
Ich mach die ersten drei Schritte und schon fällt der erste Satz
„Brauchst du Hasch?“
Seh ich so aus, als würd ich´s brauchen?
Ich bin so schon gefickt, ich muss nicht auch noch rauchen
Das ist mein Teil von Neukölln, hier wohnen fast nur Libanesen
Die Leuchtreklamen kannst du hier schon nicht mehr lesen
In meinem Kreuzberg 61 bin ich lang nicht mehr gewesen
Dort bin ich aufgewachsen und kenn so ziemlich jeden Tresen
Vom „Nordschlösschen“ zum [????]
Von der „V-Bar“ bis zum „Lobo“
In der „Junction-Bar“ lief Hip Hop und im „Ex“ nur Pogo-Pogo
Meine alte Wohnung war hier neben der Friesenwache
Die Bullen riefen uns beim Vornamen, ließen uns hier überwachen
Und wenn wir Scheiße machten
Uns auch mal gratis übernachten
Danke, Jungs, Danke von mir, von uns
Danke für die Stockschläge ganz ohne Grund
Ging es hier mal wieder rund
Lag eine Hand für mich im Feuer
Es ist Taibo, meine Atze, genannt „Mister Paranoia“
Die Gangster sitzen auf´m Dach, die Zecken aufm Keuer
Heut sind die Mieten teuer
Und so ziemlich alle weg
Und was übrig bleibt, ist Kreuzbergs anerkannter Yuppie-Dreck
Hier schmeißt man seinen Fuffi mal eben für´n Sushi weg
Der Bergmannkiez ist lang nicht mehr das, was er mal war
Und Neukölln wird immer ärmer und das von Jahr zu Jahr
Ich bin mal hier, mal da
Und genieß die Atmosphäre
Doch bleibt Kreuzberg meine Liebe und Neukölln nur ne Affäre

How much lonesome can the wind blow in?
How much sadness can the gray sky cry?
Don't know where all that sunshine went
Since you said goodbye

Crashing waves from an ocean blue
Scattered footprints of the love we knew
Thunder shut me from deep within
Stormy weather once again

When the wind dies down and you have found
A new place to stay tonight
I hope that all your sunny days
Won't bring tears to your eyes

How much lonesome can the wind blow in?
How much sadness can the gray sky cry?
Don't know where all that sunshine went
Stormy weather once again

If it ever breaks the stars will take
The twinkling in the night
And the heart that once was broken in two
Can get back to feeling right

How much lonesome can the wind blow in?
How much sadness can the gray sky cry?
Don't know where all that sunshine went
Since you said goodbye

Crashing waves from an ocean blue
Scattered footprints of the love we knew
Thunder shut me from deep within
Stormy weather once again

Thunder shut me from deep within

Kein Besuch, keine Bitch kommt zu mir, heute kann ich mich komplett auf mich konzentrieren
Desinteressiert, bin zuhause und chill. Lieg allein auf der Couch, im TV läuftt nur Müll
Ich finde zu mir, finde raus, was ich will. Manchmal denk ich, ich hätte mein' Traum nicht erfüllt

Ich merk der Abgrund ist nah, wer ist kaputter als wir? Menschen gehen über Leichen für bedrucktes Papier!
Auf lange Sicht macht das Geld uns krank. Du und Ich, wir sind in dieser Welt gefangen. Ich bin ein teil davon
Ich wär gern einfach nur zu haus, doch muss raus, weil das Glück nicht von alleine kommt

[Intro]
I feel bad already
I feel bad already
I feel bad already
I feel bad already


It's been a while since I jumped in but I'm back and ready
So let me settle in, relax a sec, my bag was heavy
Stretch my legs, spread my wings it ain't necessary
But I should apologise 'cause damn man I feel bad already

[Verse 1]
I don't mean to be amazing it's just how they bred me
Changing a lane trying to make sure all these rappers get me
About time that I tried to make a grand reentry
But I should step back 'cause man, I feel bad already

Mad respect to the heads from before us
To all those who had opened the doors up
So we can walk in, new kids taking the game by storm
I know that we can be a little raucous
I got the gift of genetics
Tryna get a leg up like I'm lifting prosthetics
Transmitting a message to any who act like they forgetting
Who is I, Mr. Spit fly, lyrical weapon

So who do you be
I got depth, you're spitting 2D
Man, it's about time I introduced me
I'm 6 foot 2 inch
Fluent in human, the coolest to do it
So you can call the dude Finch

You can bet that I'm a nuisance
I'm flexing but you know that I can prove it
I'm stupid, I'm foolish
The rule is it isn't worth regretting
So pretend like you ain't fond of me
'coz damn man I feel bad already

[Hook]
I feel bad already
I feel bad already
I feel bad already
I feel bad already

[Verse 2]
Man I'm a menace
Directing impeccable sentences
Yes, I'm a tad egotistic
I'm shredding my own negative ideology
Dodging the bullet while going ballistic
Ready and prepping to kick it
I'd ask if I can but I really don't care what you think
I'm a misfit, sent on a mission
And I don't slip like Kess in the rink, uh

Sorry, I let my hubris get the best of me
I know I'm not the greatest of all time
I'm not the best MC
I mean I just started this with Leonardo
But my keen bravado has got me cooked
Like I was hooked on methamphetamines

But I'm ostensibly a novice, so they've said to me
It's funny, I think I'm better than they'll ever be
But hey, that's me
I'm not humble I won't pretend to be
I'm only here to stir up the pot like broth recipes

Gosh, almost forgot that I'm divine
Forget not being the best
I'm so fresh I'm on the vine (What's the time?)
'bout the hour that I kill it
Incidentally, fairly sure that I just did
Damn it man, I feel bad already

[Interlude]
I just wanted to stop for a second here and make sure that everybody knows that everything I'm saying is completely ironic, I don't actually believe that I'm the greatest rapper of all time, so, let's continue

So who do you be
I got- I got depth
So who do you be
I got- I got depth
So who do you be
I got- I got depth

Foolish to prove it
So who do you be
I got- I got depth
So who do you be
I got- I got depth
So who do you be
I got- I got depth

Alone
You turn your head around
On your own
The order to the man
One strong drink
Searching for that question
To give yourself some reason
To talk to a stranger

Don't be afraid
We all need someone
Who is on our side
Some things must not wait
And a pledge short lived or long
Is all that's needed
Who'll help

Don't isolate
If you see someone not dancing
It's your fault
Never is too late
And a dance short lived or long
Is all that's needed
Who will help this lonely one

Move
Direction seems unknown
Walk
Another hour passed
And still alone
Searching for that question
Looking for somebody
Trying to find that person
To love
Just be aware

Asking for help from someone

They say that life can decide in the blink of eye
If our silly little dreams will ever come true
But the dreams in my mind all go by so slowy
What the hell else can I do

I wanna slow it all down and watch it roll by
See where the sweet melody falls
I wanna roll off the tempo, lay back and get high
Cause it's only time and time after all

I've grown tired of cold places and the same old cold faces
And I'm tired of the smoke they all blow in my eyes
I'm sick of the banging, can't take no more clanging
I'm tired of yelling over top that back line

They say time takes care of itself
It gets by without no help at all
Like a jar of sand that sits on the shelf
It's only time and time after all

Walking through the seasons
Seems so tiring
The air stirs in low hums
Of open windows as lives
Spill onto the street

The song plays without guilt
And you were disaster peaking with sunrise
Peaking with sunrise

I fold these hands shut
To shut out your glimmering, your glimmering

So meet me by the lamppost
So we can chat like old friends

[Verse 1]
Like we always do about this time, ink lines for the sick rhyme inclined
It’s grimy shit but naught that can’t be fixed with a little bit of spitshine
Big time like Frankie in Vegas, inspiring like Ali and Frazier
Spit it out till we spilling out on to the street start a party up with our neighbours
I’d rather be part of your playlist, than ever be part of the A-list
Harness the energy, heart of a pedigree with the scars of a sadist
I go so hard on the pavement; I go so far with my statements
That I don’t know where they end and where I start it’s all part of game it’s
The farthest I’ve came since I started to play it, I spar with these artists, the heartless and brainless
We’re harnessed by chains that are hard to escape and you change then they label us bastards or traitors
They’re charlatans, they’re haters, they start on us but they’re fake as
Our parliament, but don’t be disheartened by them pardon their failures
If we don’t forgive our enemies, we’ll crawl the walls like centipedes
Burn our energy like fossil fuels and fuel our own damn effigy
And we’ll all burn like Hennessey, so keep on then and step with me
John Lennon let it be, dead the beef like abattoirs, before these scavengers tear at me

[Chorus]
I’ve been waiting to come back
Like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack
Getting ready to blow
I’ve been waiting to come back
Like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack
Getting ready to blow

[Verse 2]
And it might blow up but it won’t go pop
And it might blow up but it won’t burst
She said she might grow old but she won’t grow up
Well she might, but only if I go first
She wears her heart on her sleeve like; she’s wearing a patch on her shoulder
It’s not a matter of whether I can catch her, more a matter of whether I can hold her
She thinks out loud she’s got me; she laughs with her whole body
I think about how she got it all figured out and wonder why she’d even want me?
Each night I find it’s the same ole, when I crawl inside in the evening
I lie down next to an angel; fall asleep and fly with my demons
They say don’t live in the past and live each day like it was your last but
I’d rather live each moment like it was my first, take it slow and sip from the glass
Savour the moment, spit vicious bars then pray for opponents
Sounds so serious don’t it? But I’m not concerned with a thing
This is book three, Tolkien, Return of the King
The kings have arrived; we drink from the sky
We fall from all ‘cause we think we can fly
But our wings have been tied, and the winging and lies
Have me I’m wishing that I could bridge the divide
You living the life? In the blink of an eye
The shine of the bling and the rims that you ride
Can all disappear so live for the rhyme
Not material things your gift can provide

[Chorus]
I’ve been waiting to come back
Like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack
Getting ready to blow
I’ve been waiting to come back
Like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack
I’m getting ready now, I’m getting ready

[Verse 3]
Since State of the Art we’ve stayed in the yard just waiting to start this shit all over
Laying in bars for a day and a half, had to switch from gin to soda
And by like mid October, record was six months over
Due and I‘m like, 'Dude, what you expect? I’m only three months sober'
Coming up turning tree trunks over, running up burning divas, posers
Run amok till the sun is up or till one of us # live la vida loca
I’m gonna roll until I fold, like I got a hold of Propafol
So beautiful to know you all but for now peace I’m over and out

È evidente che l'inizio del millenio
Costringe alla visione di spettacoli osceni
Fascisti che credono in un nuovo ventennio
Leghisti che disinfettano i treni
Dal padre-padrone al figlio deficente
L'impresa di famiglia è di nuovo fiorente
Mi sogno che basti una canna sul divano
Per farti schiavo di San patrignano

Aspettano il momento per far scherzi da prete

Camina Don Boyso, mañanita fría
A tierra de moros
A buscar amiga
Hallola lavando
En la fuente fría

—¿Qué haces ahí, mora, hija de judía?
Deja a mi caballo
Beber agua fría
—Reviente el caballo y quien lo traía
Que yo no soy mora ni hija de judía
Soy una cristiana
Que aquí estoy cautiva

Cuando el rey, mi padre
Plantó aquí esta oliva
Él se la plantara
Yo se la tenía
Mi hermano Don Boyso
Los toros corrían

—¿Y cómo te llamas?
—Yo soy Rosalinda
—Pues tú, por las señas
Mi hermana serías

Abra la mi madre puertas de alegría
Por traerla nuera le traigo su hija

Man könnte sagen, dass dies ein eigenständiges Liebeslied ist
Es gibt nichts was ihr wichtiger ist als die Liebe
Das heißt nicht dass unsere Liebe nicht groß und stark ist

Man könnte sagen, das dies wieder eines dieser langweiligen Liebeslieder ist
Zusammen sein und für immer treu
Und Heute ist es das Gleiche wie damals
Ich mache es auf einem anderen Weg
Ich mache es auf einem anderen Weg

Ich werde dir zeigen wie man mich erobert
Kann ich, kann ich
Ich werde dir zeigen wie man mich antörnt
Richtig an, richtig an
Ich werde dir zeigen wie du mich berühren sollst
Richtig an, richtig an, richtig an
Richtig an, richtig an, richtig an

Es macht Spaß das viele Männer mich so sehen möchten
Und ich nehme sie mit nach Hause und lasse sie mir den Weg Zeigen
Und sicher werde ich einige mögen, aber den Rest lasse ich Zum Spielen zurück

Traitor,David Dunn,"

[Verse 1]
As I sit behind this screen
Typing words the way they seem
They come spinning out my soul
Leave me bare and so exposed
And as I sort through all this mess
That’s always jumbled in my head
I am ashamed of who I am
A wayward son, a wayward man

[Hook]
And I’ll find
That my heart is a traitor
Inside
Can you come and vindicate it?

[Chorus]
I wanna, wanna love you
But I don’t understand
Why my heart is a traitor
I love what I can’t stand
I wanna, wanna follow all that you've ever said
But my Heart is a traitor
I wanna be free of this
Can you break me free of this?

[Verse 2]
As I wait for the sunrise
I see a new and shining sky
And a night that’s gone away
I see so clearly my mistakes
And as you reach deep in me
Show me what I wouldn't see
And I am humbled by your touch
How could I ever be enough?

[Hook]
When I’ll find
That my heart is a traitor
Inside
Won't you come and vindicate it?

[Chorus]
I wanna, wanna love you
But I don’t understand
Why my heart is a traitor
I love what I can’t stand
I wanna, wanna follow all that you've ever said
But my Heart is a traitor
I wanna be free of this
Can you break me free of this?

[Bridge]
As these words come pouring out
I finally know what they're about
About the God who conquers all
Who Helps me stand when I can’t crawl
And when I’m down on my face
Because I've chosen my own way
And even though I've done him wrong
He is there with open arms

[Hook]
When I’ll find
That my heart is a traitor
Inside
Then He comes and vindicates it

[Chorus]
I wanna, wanna love you
(Oh yeah, yeah, oh)
But I don’t understand
Why my heart is a traitor
(My heart is a traitor)
I love what I can’t stand
I wanna, wanna follow all that you've ever said
(I wanna follow, everything, everything)
But my Heart is a traitor
I wanna be free of this
(I wanna be free of this)
Can you break me free of this?
(Can you break, can you break me free of this?)
I wanna be free of this
(I wanna be free of this)
Can you break me free of this?

Always right up on yo' pocket, yeah

I'm Gettin Money,2Pac,"

[Intro]
Get money, nigga
Yeah - aw yeah
Dedicate this one to all the hustlers
That get up every motherfuckin' mornin' and put they work in
I see you - I see you, boy

[Verse 1]
I'm up before sunrise first to hit the block
Lil' bad motherfucker with a pocket full of rocks
Learned to throw them thangs, get my skinny lil' ass kicked
Niggas laughed, 'til the first motherfucker got blasted
I put the nigga in his casket
And now they coverin' the bastard in plastic
I smoke blunts on the regular, fuck when it counts
Tryin' to make a million dollars out a quarter ounce
Gettin' ghost on the five-o, fuck them hoes
Got a .45 screamin' out ""Survival""
Hey nigga, can I lay low, cook some yeyo?
Holla ""five-o"" when I say so
Don't wanna go to the pen', I'm hittin' fences
NARC's on a nigga back missin' me by inches
And they say how do you survive, weighin' one-fifty-five
In the city where the little niggas die
Tell mama don't cry, 'cause even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a real G

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' money
(""If you die, you's a busta, 'cause real niggas don't die)
I'm gettin' money
(""If you die, you's a busta, 'cause real niggas don't die)
Yeah, I'm gettin' money
(""If you die, you's a busta, 'cause real niggas don't die)
I'm gettin' money
(""If you die, you's a busta, 'cause real niggas don't die)
(Watch out, rollers, nigga)

[Verse 2]
Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
Pour some liquor on the curb, for my homies that deserve it
If I wanna make a million, gotta stay dealin'
Kinda boomin' round the way, I think today I make a killin'
Dressin' down like I'm dirty, but only on the block
Just a clever disguise, to keep me runnin' from the cops
I'm gettin' high, think I'll die if I don't get no ends
I'm in a bucket but I'm ridin' it like it's a Benz
I hit the strip I let my music bump
Drinkin' liquor and I'm lookin' for a bitch to fuck
Rather die makin' money, than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo
I need money in a major way
Time to fuck my girl, she gettin' paid today, ha ha ha
I live Thug Life and let the money come to me
'Cause they can never take the game from a young G

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' money
(""If you die, you's a busta, 'cause real niggas don't die)
I'm gettin' money
(""If you die, you's a busta, 'cause real niggas don't die)
I'm gettin' money
(""If you die, you's a busta, 'cause real niggas don't die)
I'm gettin' money
(""If you die, you's a busta, 'cause real niggas don't die)

[Verse 3]
Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do
Now watch a young motherfucker pull the trigger too
Raise up, and don't let them see ya cry
Dry your eyes, young nigga, time for do or die
I pack a pistol in my pocket, ready on my Glock
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
I done seen a motherfucker peep pain
At point blank range cause he slept on the game
Ain't a damn thing changed
You're shakin' the dice, now roll 'em
If you can't stand pain better hold 'em
'Cause ain't no tellin' what ya might roll
You might fold, catch AIDS from a slight cold
You better live ya life to the fullest
Be quick to kill a bull, got a pistol, motherfucker, better pull it
And even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a young G

[Chorus]

I'm gettin' money

Don't be ashamed to paint a picture of yourself

On Time As a Helix of Precious Laughs,Happy The Man,"

Pretty lady holding hands with time
Growing older as the day goes by
What is she to do? Or what have you?
The sun is shining on her face so fair
The sounds of children floating in the air
Hello, time
Does she really care?
Or think, think
""Old age cannot touch me now
I wallow in the laugh""
That's what it's all about
We fill our lives with precious laughs

What is there in a laugh that time avoids to know?
Look at all the people out there playing
Running from the past
""Can I make my bus,"" he cries, ""or will I see the show?""
We surround ourselves with time
Building with the laughter a doorway to the mind

No yesterdays, no tomorrows
Time is a helix of precious laughs

We are only men
We eat, we speak in fancy wordy ways
But down inside the person acting out the part
The place where we all stay
There is the heart where all are one, a place away from time
Direct our thoughts from there
Freeing with the laughter a doorway to the light

Lefty,Chuck Brodsky,"

Lefty’s in the minors, got his shoulder packed in ice
He’s trying to hang on there against all that good advice
Used to throw that sinker but that sinkerball went south
And then they started calling him for going to his mouth

Lefty holds the record for most strike-outs in a game
Once upon a time he really threw a ball of flame
Some wish he’d gone gracefully when his time finally came
They put Lefty on waivers but nobody laid a claim

It’s a Godalmighty shame - he got too old to play the game
Where he made himself a name - and they call him Lefty

Lefty wore the pinstripes for a good number of years
The bleacher bums all loved him - they were tanked up with their beer
He used to throw that heater, but the radar does not lie
And now when Lefty lays one up there you can kiss that thing goodbye

It’s a Godalmighty shame - he got too old to play the game
Where he made himself a name - and they call him Lefty

Now they’re calling him from Cooperstown - out on the bullpen phone
Some little field in Bumfolk where the grass is overgrown
It’s the bottom of the 7th and a runner just got on
And they’re calling for a lefty...but Lefty’s not the one

There’s a capital “L” in Lefty, so say it with respect
He’s Senor Lefty down in Mexico & he’s Lefty in Quebec
He could smoke you, he could fool you, throw a curve around your neck
He could paint one on the corners, he could fill the upper deck

It’s a Godalmighty shame - he got too old to play the game
Where he made himself a name - and they call him Lefty

Cherry blossom
This is goodbye
Come here lately
And you'll fly

[Pre-Chorus]
When they say
What it's worth
The world tells you first
And you know
Where to hurt

[Chorus]
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
Have you heard?

Lover let me please
Fall on down your knees
Lover let me please
Be the one
Know the prayers to make
For lovers made to fade
(lovers made to fade)
And when you swore to wait and only burst

The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
Have you heard?

[Verse 2]
Yes I loved you
As a matter of fact
Your furs are wrapped up
And that's that

[Chorus]
Lover let me please
Fall onto your knees
You once made me smile
Then you strayed

The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
Have you heard?
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
Have you heard?

[Bridge]
Lover have you breached?
To make for your release?
(To make for your release)
So I'll no longer err by your side
What's to hide?

[Outro]
The world's on fire
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Monday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Tuesday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Wednesday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Thursday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Friday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Saturday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Sunday

Amor de Índio - Ao Vivo,Maria Bethânia,"

Tudo que move é sagrado
E remove as montanhas
Com todo o cuidado, meu amor
Enquanto a chama arder
Todo dia te ver passar
Tudo viver a teu lado
Com arco da promessa
Do azul pintado, pra durar
Abelha fazendo o mel
Vale o tempo que não voou
A estrela caiu do céu
O pedido que se pensou
O destino que se cumpriu
De sentir seu calor
E ser todo
Todo dia é de viver
Para ser o que for
E ser tudo
Sim, todo amor é sagrado
E o fruto do trabalho
É mais que sagrado, meu amor
A massa que faz o pão
Vale a luz do teu suor
Lembra que o sono é sagrado
E alimenta de horizontes
O tempo acordado, de viver
No inverno te proteger, no verão sair pra pescar
No outono te conheçer, primavera poder gostar
No estio me derreter
Pra na chuva dançar e andar junto
O destino que se cumpriu
De sentir seu calor e ser tudo

Du haut de ma tour,Rémy,"

[Couplet 1]
Encore une nuit pleine de cauchemars, des journées à s'tuer la santé
Bébé, mon cœur est hanté, peur de n'pas savoir faire
Avant d'voir la lumière, faut voir le noir si tu penses tomber
Écoute mes sons et tu verras qu'à deux, on peut le faire
On a toujours quelqu'un sur qui compter : une icône, un modèle
La poisse, je l'ai vu v'nir comme le phare de la Tour Eiffel
J'suis monté tout en haut d'ma tour et d'en haut tout m'a l'air net
Si j'descends mon pote et ben j'pourrais tous les uer-t
Le vent m'fait frissonner, pas plus qu'les frères au cachot
Un p'tit m'a vite dévisagé, on nique la mère à crâne chauve
Du haut d'ma tour, j'dénonce c'que nos mères voient par la f'nêtre
Pointé du doigt parce que

[Refrain]
Du haut d'ma tour, j'vois qu'les H.L.M
Et la vie est parfaite que quand j'regarde la lune
Du haut d'ma tour, j'vois qu'les H.L.M
On a tous perdu des frères, c'est la même du Nord au Sud
Du haut d'ma tour, j'vois qu'les H.L.M
Un coup d'feu, un cri, une fleur fanée sur l'bitume
Du haut d'ma tour, j'vois qu'les H.L.M
Vécu dans les coins sales, ouais, ma vie c'est ça

[Couplet 2]
J'veux pas avoir le pouvoir, juste rapper la rue et éloigner ma mère du trou noir
Faut l'faire, faut pas que l'vouloir, trotinne après tes objectifs, quelqu'un va courir pour toi
J'ai travaillé dur, j'ai obtenu c'que j'voulais, j'ai du montré qui j'étais, qu'la vie fait pas c'qu'on est mon grand (jamais)
J'ai couru longtemps dans la brume puis un reflet, dans tes yeux, j'essaie de voir si mon bonheur, tu l'veux vraiment
Les sentiments ne font qu'freiner mais à deux, on va plus loin
Et ouais mon pote, j'ai zoné mais un moment faut prendre son train
Et j'réagis mal devant les fausses promesses, puis j'prends un coup car les faux refrés, ça tue pas mais ça blesse
Y'a personne pour m'consoler, en même temps j'parle qu'à ma personne
Qui cherchait trèfle à quatre feuilles mais l'bonheur s'trouve dans l'portefeuille
J'écoute ces notes de guitare et ça m'donne envie d'parler
Et j'en rigole car si j'rappe, c'est parce que

Cómo Te Va Mi Amor,Arena Hash,"

Si vieras ahora.. Como siento yo..
Todas las cosas..
No lo soportarias..
Podrias matar con tal de salir..
Si supieras como deje de llorar..
Y recordar tantas cosas..
Pensarias que el tiempo
Té a sacado de mí..
Yo no te olvido..
Cómo te va mi amor..
Dime cómo te va..
Cómo te va mi amor..
Siento un gran vació..
Una profundidad..
Qué adormece mi mente..
Me quedo dormido..
De tanto pensar..
Que vengas a mí..
Y es que no eh entendido..
Qué aquí no eres más..
Qué brillos y sueños..
Porque estoy perdido..
En esta ansiedad..
Yo no te olvido..
Cómo te va mi amor..
Dime cómo te va..
Cómo te va mi amor..
Sí alguien podría sacarrme..
De aquí..
Si alguien me hablara..
Cómo me hablas a mí..
Yo no te olvido..
Cómo te va mi amor..
Dime cómo te va..
Cómo te va mi amor..
Sabes que no me va bien..
Y que mi hablar se nota..
Qué necesite placer..
De una mujer preciosa..
Si te pudiera sentir..
Tan solo una hora..
Podría hablar de amor..
Mil horas de amor..
Vamos no me mires más..
Si la verdad me aflora..
Es que ya no puedo más..
Solo en pensar me agobia..
Si te pudiera sentir..
Tan solo una hora..
Podria hablar de amor..
Mil horas..
Mil horas de amor.. (bis)
Mil horas de amor..
Mil horas de amor..

When I'm Gone,Eminem,"

[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""
But baby, wait! – ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

Love Is Gone,G-Eazy,"

[Chorus: Drew Love]
It's hard to sleep these days
The sounds of all the screams keep me awake
Love is gone, love is gone
Bend until we break, stand by and watch us all go up in flames
Love is gone, love is gone (uh, yeah)

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Shit, the world is in flames
We worry about materials and the simplest things
When cops are killing people, and they can't take the blame
They get acquitted, then you wonder why all the people rage, stupid
We all keep praying for peace, praying for progress
If you live in the hills then you stay in the projects
So folks won't listen if they think what I'm saying is conscious
They'd rather hear me turning up on some simpler topics
Yeah, so what's my place, am I outta line?
Then speaking on what's going on and saying what's on my mind?
This shit is fucked up, plus it's happening all the time
My job, as a rapper is to entertain, we tryna shine
I'm not no politician, but they listen, somebody inform 'em
All the kids gotta find out what's really important
I got a platform and a voice and a stage to perform on
Music could be a good escape, but outside it's been storming, yeah

[Chorus: Drew Love]
It's hard to sleep these days
The sounds of all the screams keep me awake
Love is gone, love is gone
Bend until we break, stand by and watch us all go up in flames
Love is gone, love is gone (yeah, uh)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
As I sit in the studio, guess the thinking is
If the statement's too crazy, then should I finish this?
Or if my image is pretty, don't wanna blemish this
Or ever split up my fans, reduce my relevance
Pay attention and understand what the premise is
Everything not gravy, we can't pretend it is
So I salute YG, fuck the president
'Cause he a fucking racist supported by white supremacists
Fuck Donald, go back to just running businesses
We all wishing somehow we could've prevented this
Until we all love each other, nobody benefits
Minorities and feminists, trans, gays, and immigrants
The government mix politics and religiousness
So a man's body's more free than a woman's is
The anger is real, the riots are limitless
And nothing's gonna change 'til we killing off all this ignorance, yeah

[Chorus: Drew Love]
It's hard to sleep these days
The sounds of all the screams keep me awake
Love is gone, love is gone
Bend until we break, stand by and watch us all go up in flames
Love is gone, love is gone

[Outro: Drew Love]
Monsters, we've turned into monsters
How did we get the way we are?
How did we get the way we are?
How did we get the way we are?
Our conscience, we lost it
How did we get the way we are?
How did we get the way we are?
How did we get the way we are?
We are, we are
How did we get the way we are?
We are, we are
How did we get the way we are?
We are, we are
How did we get the way we are?

Lost
Try to create a reality
Not made of facts based off lust and greed Is this the role you were meant to lead?
Not born to die, we were made to be free!
If you desire to be a king (To be a king)
Then show truth for the world to see (For the world to see)
I understand that this is overwhelming for you (Showing this light)
It doesn't have to be (There's a way) The spirit comes through
Ask now, how a man can change. How can we move forward without a leader to follow?
I need a compass to show me the way!
Is this where I lay this life down and is this where I start again?
Oh God please show me the path I should take before it becomes too late!
Oh We Can Grow! If we could learn to forgive!
The passions of others that may spark a flame
They are the dreams and desires of the ones that made the game
They are the ones that made the game, but still they will tell you that everything has changed (that everything has changed)
Oh We Can Grow! If we could learn to forgive!
No one can change my life like you!
The passions of others will make you cold! (They will make you cold)
If change is in your heart, then show the world. (Then show the world)
Show the world what you believe!

[Текст песни «Киллер»]

[Куплет 1: Al Solo, (ШЕFF)]
Его жизнь была, как в кинофильме
Как в чёрно-белом скучном сериале мыльном
Где в изобилии лились пот и слёзы
Где эпизоды повторялись без еды и дозы
Отец его ушёл в далёком детстве
И свою мать с тех пор он не помнил трезвой
Никак с законом не складывалась дружба
Зато потом в Афгане сложилась служба
(Взрыв, осколок, лазарет, без наркоза
Погибшие, близкие с красными розами
Как две контузии с командиром
Армейская доля, друзья, дедовщина
Он стал мужчиной, но на гражданке
Бычка, пьянки, статья, хулиганка
Суд, он оказался на зоне
А за стеной Россию рвали на доли)

[Припев: Al Solo, (ШЕFF)]
Он просто взял и надел капюшон
Плюнул и в бандиты пошёл
С армейским оружием в поисках лучшего
Пока вся страна Ельцина слушала
(Просто взял и надел капюшон
Плюнул и в бандиты пошёл
С армейским оружием в поисках лучшего
Пока страна Ельцина слушала)

[Куплет 2: Al Solo]
А жизнь на воле с запахом алкоголя
Без работы, жилья, среди жулья с района
Из запоя выходил для того, чтоб снова
Занять немного, и всё опять по новой
Пока не встретил своего командира бывшего
Который бригадиром был или чьей-то крышей
Но так уж вышло, что друг в беде не кинул
Всё же солдатскую пайку пополам делили
«Тут дело есть, надо помочь в разборке
Из расчехлённой снайперской винтовки»
Той пачки денег в обмен на пулю в теле
Хватило снять ему квартиру более-менее
И понеслась — за заказом ещё заказ
Из поражённых целей карьера складывалась
Зависела зарплата бывшего солдата
От чего и жизнь на войне когда-то

[Припев: Al Solo, (ШЕFF)]
(Он просто взял и надел капюшон
Плюнул и в бандиты пошёл
С армейским оружием в поисках лучшего
Пока вся страна Ельцина слушала)
Просто взял и надел капюшон
Плюнул и в бандиты пошёл
С армейским оружием в поисках лучшего
Пока страна Ельцина слушала

[Куплет 3: ШЕFF]
Летели годы, свинцовые вести
Почерк его мокрых дел в кругах стал известен
Мир тесен, девяностые контрасты
Он заказы принимал, как спецагент, по факсу
Утопая в баксах, оставался лучшим
Но понимал — над головой сгустились тучи
Чем дальше — круче, жить осталось мало
Закрутил водоворотом чёрный нал криминала
А молва летала — бригады косят менты
Чтобы не погибнуть, закладывают свои
Как ни крути, но не было расклада миром
Засада, выстрел, по наводке бригадира
Такое было время, рынок ещё делили
Так он оказался на Ваганьковском в могиле
Его проводили, не жалея денег
А бывший командир плакал на коленях

[Припев: Al Solo, (ШЕFF)]
Он просто взял и надел капюшон
Плюнул и в бандиты пошёл
С армейским оружием в поисках лучшего
Пока вся страна Ельцина слушала
(Просто взял и надел капюшон
Плюнул и в бандиты пошёл
С армейским оружием в поисках лучшего
Пока страна Ельцина слушала)
